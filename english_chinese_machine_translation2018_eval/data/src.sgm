<seg id="427">35	87	Come into the garden with me</seg>

<seg id="868">10	114	...doesn't mean there isn't a larger world.</seg>
<seg id="869">47	274	This is a view of the Temple of Mars Ultor as it looks today.</seg>
<seg id="870">29	506	Give it a try. If it doesn't work, send him through the event horizon.</seg>
<seg id="871">13	496	Although I'm still finding that really hard to believe.</seg>
<seg id="872">29	584	Before, when you thought... you know</seg>
<seg id="873">39	410	I would've waited a thousand years for her.</seg>
<seg id="874">7	223	...I'd be one of their 10 most wanted.</seg>
<seg id="875">50	279	Look at how many lived here. - You can say that again.</seg>

<seg id="878">23	1157	This may be my chance to prove that those words really mean something.</seg>
<seg id="879">14	168	Sorry. My left, your right. - Okay.</seg>
<seg id="880">35	433	l bet it has three swimming pools.</seg>

<seg id="885">44	219	Also it's a time where in Germany particularly, but not only in Germany, men were dueling.</seg>
<seg id="886">45	338	I remind you of a model of it here again, and the relationship of that Temple of Divine Claudius with the temple, conventional temple, on top of a very tall podium.</seg>
<seg id="887">33	192	There's room for a hundred more agents.</seg>
<seg id="888">45	395	This was thought, for a very long time, to be the case that there was an elaborate entranceway, with columns and projecting entablatures, the sort of thing that we haven't seen yet in built architecture, but we did see in Second Style Roman wall painting.</seg>
<seg id="889">44	204	Now, we have friends in France who still read The Last of the Mohicans.</seg>
<seg id="890">7	810	...I'll give you said dollar. What do you say?</seg>
<seg id="891">11	425	Both countries believe they have a role to play...</seg>

<seg id="893">30	608	Of the message that appeared to be left behind something bad happens</seg>
<seg id="894">22	708	That was the Kremlin. Viktor lvanov is dead.</seg>

<seg id="896">23	1	Neil Diamond. Hot August night, 1972.</seg>
<seg id="897">25	723	You are of no use to anyone dead.</seg>
<seg id="898">47	330	We see here in the center, not surprisingly, Mars Ultor himself; Mars Ultor depicted with a bare chest.</seg>
<seg id="899">35	631	May l have this dance. Madam Bakshi?</seg>
<seg id="900">17	150	Right after my shift, with Kyle.</seg>
<seg id="901">13	184	On your way to being... - Christiane Amanpour.</seg>
<seg id="902">47	276	You can see that the podium is tall.</seg>
<seg id="903">39	256	Are you naked today, Dr. Evans?</seg>
<seg id="904">24	56	My own coin to see each victor paid,</seg>
<seg id="905">17	141	No. There's no point in worrying them.</seg>
<seg id="906">14	184	I really miss Stars Hollow High.</seg>
<seg id="907">1	669	Anand, let me ask you this</seg>
<seg id="908">47	182	They did import a certain amount of Greek marble to use, for some buildings, but it wasn't available at a low enough cost to allow the kind of full-scale marble building that they wanted to do.</seg>
<seg id="909">14	103	Fine. Then I will curse you constantly and in several languages.</seg>
<seg id="910">16	394	Zzyzx killed Baylin because he knew too much about them.</seg>

<seg id="914">1	768	John Yonover loved to break the tie.</seg>
<seg id="915">32	243	I think it should be this shirt with these.</seg>
<seg id="916">53	79	Let's promise to keep then, OK?</seg>
<seg id="917">11	582	I'm told that I should hold it up.</seg>
<seg id="918">1	794	The next day, I wake up, and I don't want to even bother.</seg>
<seg id="919">16	221	You must have seen me when you worked at Zzyzx</seg>

<seg id="924">7	1167	...you think you're living in someplace magical...</seg>
<seg id="925">47	493	And you can see, from this particular view, why some people think of it as a kind of white elephant that really doesn't fit the tenor of the city.</seg>
<seg id="926">11	641	See? It crossed quite easily, huh?</seg>
<seg id="927">9	389	Even the people, Parisians, they are shit.</seg>
<seg id="928">32	406	That's probably why I come out here.</seg>

<seg id="931">29	301	Well, I suppose the Wraith has to have evolved of something</seg>
<seg id="932">19	124	Look at your hair. What's your problem?</seg>
<seg id="933">31	53	Bullshit. We're taking out 90 percent of their artillery in the first 90 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="937">41	529	In the matter of Ramirez vs. Gro plus foods incorporated, we find in favor of the defendant, gro plus foods.</seg>
<seg id="938">5	400	Yes, you remind me of Yon-hwa!</seg>
<seg id="939">20	625	It's funny, I just have this strange feeling, like... something's missing.</seg>

<seg id="1240">44	222	Most of them don't get killed.</seg>
<seg id="1241">45	472	So this very much in keeping; we're seeing in architecture something very much in keeping Vis-à-vis decoration, as we see in Fourth Style Roman wall painting.</seg>
<seg id="1242">27	402	This young lady's a Nazi, a hero of the Fatherland.</seg>

<seg id="1283">45	324	Here's another view where you can also get a great sense of these substructures, of the places where the animals were kept, and also of those openings in the ceiling that allowed them to be brought up above.</seg>
<seg id="1284">33	139	Why? - Just wake him up, boy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">28	3	right here, right now, Major. - Oh yeah? How's that?</seg>

<seg id="1300">47	507	You've got the sort of egg crate ceiling and these wonderful louvered windows that allow you to see not only Mussolini's Fascist buildings next door, but also the Mausoleum of Augustus, that it really--and the light is superb, and it really does give you a chance to see this altar in a way that it hasn't been seen before.</seg>

<seg id="1310">21	441	I saw a picture of her in InStyle when she was the fashion "don't.</seg>
<seg id="1311">46	189	So again, this has a lot to do with drinking and getting drunk, this mystery and--at least from the male point of view, because it actually seems to be the men who are drinking, and not the women who are drinking, in this particular instance.</seg>
<seg id="1312">17	475	We know what's going on. - You do?</seg>
<seg id="1313">15	153	A woman is fickle. Once she calms down, she'll come back</seg>

<seg id="1325">13	485	No, not at all. What are you doing here?</seg>
<seg id="1326">18	133	Nobody puts baby in a corner.</seg>

<seg id="1334">15	930	Yes, we should've done that before</seg>
<seg id="1335">2	545	I feel as though Liza has washed her hands and basically said, "this is all you, so if this goes up in flames, It's not my fault."</seg>
<seg id="1336">1	59	No, I'm not arguing with myself.</seg>
<seg id="1337">7	61	...but it has not been easy. Do you get that?</seg>

<seg id="2599">42	461	I would have disclosed her drinking problem on her U. N.O. S.Form.</seg>
<seg id="2600">2	871	Why didn't you go with the ballgame concept</seg>
<seg id="2601">46	198	Particularly talented; you don't see that very often in Roman painting.</seg>
<seg id="2602">22	538	Minister lvanov is beside himself with this matter.</seg>
<seg id="2603">21	463	I want you back. -What about Captain Underpants?</seg>
<seg id="2604">20	459	...I might wake up from all of this.</seg>
<seg id="2605">46	502	Again, when you wander through Pompeii, you don't see many of these portraits in situ, in large part because they were so popular with treasure hunters.</seg>
<seg id="2606">20	202	My brain activity's decreasing every day.</seg>
<seg id="2607">6	263	Did you conquer Asia by yourself Alexander?</seg>
<seg id="2608">23	443	Darren's our friend, Brett. -We knew him first.</seg>
<seg id="2609">46	368	We have an artist again, whether it's the original Greek artist, but certainly copied here by an artist in Rome, we see an incredible interest in landscape, by someone who is clearly not only looking at earlier models, but looking at landscape itself, and is very interested in depicting all kinds of anecdotal details: inlets of water, as you can see here; rocks and the way in which the rock is cast in shadow on one side and is lighted on the other;</seg>
<seg id="2610">45	14	So when Nero is forced to commit suicide in 68, we have to ask ourselves, what happened to those artists?</seg>
<seg id="2611">6	542	After that, the roman tribe, good fighters, we will beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2612">7	1141	I just wasn't ready, that's all.</seg>
<seg id="2613">35	159	Is this going to be the last time we three</seg>
<seg id="2614">44	123	But, as I suggested before in terms of the Commune, this stuff is out there in the nineteenth century as well, and so racist ideology is out there in the nineteenth century.</seg>
<seg id="2615">20	305	This is the last thing Elizabeth asked for.</seg>
<seg id="2616">31	75	...and I wilI never leave you alone.</seg>
<seg id="2617">44	456	Again, I am not knocking doing good things for people.</seg>
<seg id="2618">39	200	I don't understand you anymore, man.</seg>
<seg id="2619">13	163	I want to get the rules straight. - Oh, boy.</seg>
<seg id="2620">2	816	And I believe that, of everyone who's left,</seg>
<seg id="2621">12	171	Sweetie, I take the train every day. Safer than walking.</seg>
<seg id="2622">32	419	Held down by this force, that so troubles you, called gravity...</seg>
<seg id="2623">47	414	Because remember they're consecrating it already in 13 B. C. but the structure itself isn't built until 9, and they have to keep offering this annual sacrifice.</seg>
<seg id="2624">1	598	To stay with her first true love, Peter,</seg>
<seg id="2625">22	471	I'm touched by your deep sense of self-interest.</seg>
<seg id="2626">43	652	You could have covered it up.</seg>
<seg id="2627">39	92	Thank you. - Ah, buona sera, signore. You have a reservation?</seg>
<seg id="2628">35	166	From Amritsar to UK you are the golden girl. the center of the world</seg>
<seg id="2629">51	214	Oh you think you're bad, huh? You think you're bad?</seg>
<seg id="2630">33	474	They say we've got to eat together and use the same bathroom as the niggers.</seg>
<seg id="2631">42	523	It's as good a match as you can hope for.</seg>
<seg id="2632">17	376	Your anxious about something. Is it Zzyzx?</seg>
<seg id="2633">35	382	my eyes are searching. my hips are working my lips are waiting. take me to love my skings pulsating. my body's shaking my lips are waking. take me to love</seg>
<seg id="2634">29	127	That's it. We'll work it at our end.</seg>
<seg id="2635">7	109	Mr. Biderman has to work late and needs me to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="2636">51	543	You try to hurt my family,</seg>
<seg id="2637">18	334	Well, there's no confirmed kill as of late, but four sharks are circling;</seg>
<seg id="2638">2	975	In the back of the car and going to the supermarket.</seg>
<seg id="2639">39	208	I'll tell Dr. Perkins you're here.</seg>
<seg id="2640">20	237	Thank you. Why do you say that?</seg>
<seg id="2641">43	414	Then there must be a snitch in the middle.</seg>
<seg id="2642">50	284	Aren't you coming with us? - I've got some deliveries left.</seg>
<seg id="2643">23	740	And ever since then, I've been afraid of toilets.</seg>
<seg id="2644">54	282	Because I'm fairly confidentI can prove that didn't, uh, have that manylegitimate prescriptions.</seg>
<seg id="2645">46	300	And then you can see that not only is she working on arranging it, but she's getting help from the attendant.</seg>
<seg id="2646">8	252	And having accomplished my mission, I returned to my village,</seg>
<seg id="2647">47	130	I don't think it is any coincidence that Caesar chose this site for his Temple of Venus so that anyone who gazedat it would also see, out of the corner of their eye, the Temple of the Capitoline Triad, on the Capitoline Hill, and that would only enhance Caesar's stature in the eyes of his contemporaries.</seg>
<seg id="2648">2	568	Is based on enjoying the finer moments in life</seg>
<seg id="2649">22	58	...lgor Zaysan is a very dangerous man.</seg>
<seg id="2650">51	423	I got three witnesses saying I'm visiting my mom.</seg>
<seg id="2651">47	216	Well, that's a good story, but the likelihood is it had pretty much nothing to do with that.</seg>
<seg id="2652">35	521	Oh. yeah. yeah. yeah Oh. yeah. yeah. yeah</seg>
<seg id="2653">18	127	I want prom to be this perfect night with kyle, and all I can think about is table and chair rentals and nonrefundable deposits.</seg>
<seg id="2654">7	308	Hey, Bobby.    -Yeah?</seg>
<seg id="2655">1	890	How much we made in the task, so the men knew</seg>
<seg id="2656">2	310	Let's get all the actors in a professional look,</seg>
<seg id="2657">18	374	Nobody had to know that you were alive.</seg>
<seg id="2658">19	410	What's in your hands? - I win.</seg>
<seg id="2659">32	253	That's when I started wearing my rainbow-colored leg warmers every day.</seg>
<seg id="2660">27	100	The Fuhrer's headquarters reports repulsing an attack by Zeon spacecraft.</seg>
<seg id="2661">15	660	Time to take the mixture. I won't take it</seg>
<seg id="2662">32	211	I--I should have called, and I apologize for that.</seg>
<seg id="2663">46	449	You can see that brawl being represented in the oval arena there.</seg>
<seg id="2664">39	416	[Woman] There they are. Hey, guys.</seg>
<seg id="2665">28	533	Well, I can tell you from the quality time I spent with Ford, he was definitely not thinking straight.</seg>
<seg id="2666">2	780	Well, it did because I was able to accomplish this task.</seg>
<seg id="2667">46	256	So again we see the figure, the winged figure with the whip.</seg>
<seg id="2668">25	453	Oh, no. Not the best of ideas.</seg>
<seg id="2669">20	444	There is something that I would like to do.</seg>
<seg id="2670">29	487	We can't risk that. - Why not?</seg>
<seg id="2671">43	500	How can I live like that?</seg>
<seg id="2672">46	336	that is, to have a painting with such monumental figures that tells the story that this particular painting does.</seg>
<seg id="2673">39	407	I guess you just gotta give it some time.</seg>
<seg id="2674">47	4	It's a green diabase portrait of Caesar.</seg>
<seg id="2675">25	459	Order your men to obey me.</seg>
<seg id="2676">37	530	The friends that I had then</seg>
<seg id="2677">1	528	Well, then you better be nice.</seg>
<seg id="2678">27	103	for a man who's been utterly destroyed, Mr. Spock.</seg>
<seg id="2679">45	191	We know it also particularly well from the Theater of Marcellus in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="2680">2	258	And I love the convenience of having it with me.</seg>
<seg id="2681">22	434	And then a minute and 51 seconds pass...</seg>
<seg id="2682">1	285	It's, like, a spin on the Peter and Wendy story.</seg>
<seg id="2683">21	612	You want me to leave? -Yes!</seg>
<seg id="2684">6	15	Is a sign of deep respect for our subjects,</seg>
<seg id="2685">15	622	I'm passing out. Lie down first</seg>
<seg id="2686">13	339	Great Expectations, A Tale of Two Cities, Little Dorrit...</seg>
<seg id="2687">20	492	There's a one-day sale on hospital beds. I always wanted one.</seg>
<seg id="2688">35	495	A balding pest with too much tummy l don't want a man who's dead in the head</seg>
<seg id="2689">41	645	I just--I-I need to stay free and--and open and, uh...</seg>
<seg id="2690">14	312	This is how she'll get there. - Harvard?</seg>
<seg id="2691">45	70	We give a date of A. D. 70 to the so-called Temple of Divine Claudius, or as it is often referred to, the Claudianum in Rome, and you see again the location of that Claudianum right here.</seg>
<seg id="2692">32	249	What age do they start making fun of you if you wear the wrong clothes?</seg>
<seg id="2693">7	594	You could sleep on the couch, and you could go to the diner...</seg>
<seg id="2694">33	322	One day we won't have to say "Good morning, sir, Mr Sheriff.</seg>
<seg id="2695">51	370	I remember teaching you how to throw your first punch on this.</seg>
<seg id="2696">28	171	I want regular radio contact. Report anything unusual... and I'm talking anything unusual at all.</seg>
<seg id="2697">7	667	A grownup's library card, if you please.</seg>
<seg id="2698">22	95	Latest report suggests he's managed to stay hidden from Zaysan's troops.</seg>
<seg id="2699">7	340	We wanted him the way he was, the old Nagurski.</seg>
<seg id="2700">11	90	In everything they've dealt with, and everything they've seen...</seg>
<seg id="2701">30	39	I will do anything for it</seg>
<seg id="2702">51	335	Besides, could you imagine LT in the Bermuda shorts...</seg>
<seg id="2703">53	100	That's OK, right? And study a lot</seg>
<seg id="2704">1	123	And I think brandy is trying to get rid of me in this competition.</seg>
<seg id="2705">31	376	Priority clearance, runway 2 1 7.</seg>
<seg id="2706">25	208	Please, can't we, uh-- can't we just talk about this?</seg>
<seg id="2707">11	505	In this situation when you are fighting rebels, you have to be very tough on that.</seg>
<seg id="2708">39	476	We're not like this all the time. - [Laughter]</seg>
<seg id="2709">1	640	I told Liza I should be,</seg>
<seg id="2710">30	7	The flag of that my third rescue unit</seg>
<seg id="2711">22	639	Still on approach. ETA from target zone: 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2712">12	387	Phil and Sue Bennet. They buy what I tell them to.</seg>
<seg id="2713">22	215	Sure there's a good spot to take it out?</seg>
<seg id="2714">22	168	That's the voice of Arthur Moffit...</seg>
<seg id="2715">42	417	I take it there's a bag somewhere missing a cat.</seg>
<seg id="2716">54	417	You find it easierto lie for me if it's more subtle?</seg>
<seg id="2717">25	382	And in five years' time, if the fates play fair, then you could be mistress to the empire of Crusoe.</seg>
<seg id="2718">18	180	First we have to figure out a way to get you guys in.</seg>
<seg id="2719">9	288	No, it's not impossible. Everyone knows what to do.</seg>
<seg id="2720">46	82	And we interpret that scroll, or we interpret his participation in this scene, as probably the fact that he is reading the liturgy, the liturgy that has to do with this cult of Dionysus and with the mystical marriage of women with the god Dionysus.</seg>
<seg id="2721">41	91	Anyway, I'll be too busy with solinksy. Pass.</seg>
<seg id="2722">31	179	lt's a provocative strategy, sir, no question.</seg>
<seg id="2723">43	54	How can a church do that?</seg>
<seg id="2724">19	414	I haven't been able to get it up since Soon- yi came.</seg>
<seg id="2725">33	56	Listen to me, you backwoods shit-ass, you.</seg>
<seg id="2726">19	84	get all of them? - No...</seg>
<seg id="2727">11	386	But given the lack of time, we couldn't get a crew together...</seg>
<seg id="2728">2	253	Here's what we're gonna be doing 'cause I'm the boss.</seg>
<seg id="2729">45	448	A very large chunk of that frieze and entablature is still preserved today.</seg>
<seg id="2730">31	236	Mr. President, l've got commander Mackey on the line.</seg>
<seg id="2731">27	165	You were sent to kill our Fuhrer. Confess!</seg>
<seg id="2732">45	59	Vespasian, as he thinks about how to move forward, with architecture and to begin to commission buildings, the first thing that strikes him, very wisely, is he does not want to associate himself with Nero;</seg>
<seg id="2733">33	77	Why didn't they make a phone call?</seg>
<seg id="2734">45	61	But he looks back at the Julio-Claudians and he recognizes that there is some merit in linking himself with them, and quite specifically with Claudius, who was the best--after, in addition to Augustus-- was the best of the more recent lot, and Claudius was made into a god at his death.</seg>
<seg id="2735">6	565	The fury is too tight, damn your miserable heart, baby!</seg>
<seg id="2736">11	306	Because I speak very fast, no one can understand me.</seg>
<seg id="2737">36	363	Take the stand. - I got it. Now what'll I do with it?</seg>
<seg id="2738">3	158	You can go. The coast is clear.</seg>
<seg id="2739">46	8	We described, for example, the socle, which attempts to imitate marble incrustation in paint, which of course makes reference to the First Style of Roman wall painting.</seg>
<seg id="2740">3	488	Are you still mad at us?</seg>
<seg id="2741">30	439	I do not think that this is a good idea</seg>
<seg id="2742">1	758	Well, I didn't know what the task was gonna be.</seg>
<seg id="2743">6	593	Alexander was too in love with the glory for him to steal it,</seg>
<seg id="2744">13	644	And what year did Martin Luther address the Christian nobility?</seg>
<seg id="2745">19	72	Do you know what this is? It's so- ju.</seg>
<seg id="2746">3	205	I must find some place to hide.</seg>
<seg id="2747">20	241	Really long. And I'm gonna send it over, -and I'll talk to you tomorrow. -Wait, wait, wait.</seg>
<seg id="2748">35	248	The groom looks pretty happy. Did his parents force him into it?</seg>
<seg id="2749">42	120	And if you want me to back off, you're gonna have to do a lot better than,"it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="2750">23	1108	Jail life is real tough. They're sodomizing us in here.</seg>
<seg id="2751">21	433	What is going on between you and Jack?</seg>
<seg id="2752">8	318	Well, with your help, I'm sure I'll get back to her,</seg>
<seg id="2753">14	219	People took sides. Things got ugly. The scrunchy motion finally passed...</seg>
<seg id="2754">20	491	OK, and we're in such a hurry to move this stuff because why?</seg>
<seg id="2755">35	549	And what will Kholi sahib say?</seg>
<seg id="2756">14	747	and he's agreed to let you do some extra credit work...to help make up for the missed test today.</seg>
<seg id="2757">22	690	How much time now? - Less than two minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2758">12	142	What? Yes, but not like this. Police calls mostly.</seg>
<seg id="2759">1	1001	To clear your name and risk putting yourself</seg>
<seg id="2760">1	881	And you know what, Mr. Trump?</seg>
<seg id="2761">22	446	F-14 strike force is on deck, sir.</seg>
<seg id="2762">37	259	Which university are you going to if you get your grades?</seg>
<seg id="2763">21	838	Well, maybe not tons of other witches, but at least one.</seg>
<seg id="2764">6	458	so go on, hand it to the barbarians for their courage.</seg>
<seg id="2765">21	611	Now you're making me angry! -Go! Scat!</seg>
<seg id="2766">35	214	It's not my tie. is it?</seg>
<seg id="2767">47	271	You can see the coloration of those peperino blocks, grayish/brownish color here.</seg>
<seg id="2768">27	762	Now we'll start to live the way the Fuhrer meant us to live.</seg>
<seg id="2769">54	482	Rickettisal pox causesrash, fever, and muslepain. - pain, not paralysis.</seg>
<seg id="2770">46	161	It's a woman clothed with a white garment that is sleeveless.</seg>
<seg id="2771">44	316	I spent a fair amount of time in Australia, but it's also part of the idea of being Australian, too.</seg>
<seg id="2772">18	482	The last time I did this I was with Declan and we were both wasted.</seg>
<seg id="2773">38	6	I'm 29 years old, I'll be 30 next month,</seg>
<seg id="2774">23	594	No. No. Never heard of such a person, ever.</seg>

<seg id="2776">53	246	The rent... electricity bill, phone and gas...</seg>
<seg id="2777">22	659	Our orders were for us... - To target a dormant reactor.</seg>
<seg id="2778">35	137	An old house. an old farm. and new bills.</seg>
<seg id="2779">46	468	We see her, she's a quite attractive young woman, with wide, sort of hazel colored eyes, sharp, straight brows, straight nose, sort of Cupid's lips.</seg>
<seg id="2780">2	997	The first words were "Flo TV," "at&t,"</seg>
<seg id="2781">46	410	And then we see here what looks like some kind of a beaker, with something that may have been used to stir whatever liquid was inside.</seg>
<seg id="2782">37	977	Tell her to get the fuck out of this neighbourhood!</seg>
<seg id="2783">14	231	they'll sit down, take time and listen, even if they don't want to.</seg>
<seg id="2784">7	1107	No. It's the one on the left. Right there.</seg>
<seg id="2785">5	443	There was a plague in the village.</seg>
<seg id="2786">7	996	...and the signs started appearing on the poles...</seg>
<seg id="2787">5	216	He'll hold all of Chuyongdae's power and take charge of all ceremonies in the palace.</seg>
<seg id="2788">51	347	Oh what. Do you not like sushi? - l...uh...</seg>
<seg id="2789">28	63	You didn't seem to have a problem with mercy when it came to Colonel Sumner.</seg>
<seg id="2790">1	38	I beg you -- rid us of this plague.</seg>
<seg id="2791">27	405	The decoration was for betraying ...</seg>
<seg id="2792">14	474	What? - You drive. I'll get a ride from Sookie.</seg>
<seg id="2793">42	634	On the counts of alienation of affection, "breach of obligation and intentional infliction "of emotional distress, we, the jury, find in favor of the defendant.</seg>
<seg id="2794">31	307	That way, no risk of DPRK secrets ever leaving.</seg>
<seg id="2795">5	192	So you're the man who So-hwa asked me to take to the village.</seg>
<seg id="2796">47	505	When you confront the building itself, in its new interior,</seg>
<seg id="2797">2	768	The two of you stay here.</seg>
<seg id="2798">16	252	Tell me what's happening with you - How are things in Connecticut? - It's all good - Are you going out? - A little bit - Meeting people? - A few</seg>
<seg id="2799">16	270	I didn't know I wasn't supposed to</seg>

<seg id="2803">45	548	These are buildings that people make personal decisions about.</seg>
<seg id="2804">11	579	We can knock this out pretty fast.</seg>
<seg id="2805">44	465	A magazine called The Captain--again, this is part of the culture of imperialism and of aggressive nationalism--had a troop of mobile scouts on bikes fitted with a rifle bucket and a clip to carry a carbine, a rifle.</seg>
<seg id="2806">29	303	Listen Doctor, the Major can't be worse</seg>
<seg id="2807">1	842	A little longer maybe with a woman,</seg>

<seg id="2809">8	71	Otherwise, I have a pretty good idea of what he'll do with it,</seg>
<seg id="2810">45	55	And you'll remember the location of the Golden House of Nero, up on the Esquiline Hill, the only part of it that still survives, the so-called Esquiline Wing, which you can see there.</seg>
<seg id="2811">2	901	Stephanie, I'm a little bit confused, though.</seg>
<seg id="2812">11	236	...But I don't know where to direct it, you know?</seg>
<seg id="2813">44	8	The African continent, of which there were huge blanks in the maps of Africa, by 1914 virtually the entire continent was not only charted but had been conquered.</seg>
<seg id="2814">47	71	And we know enough about that building to know it too was an open rectangular space with colonnades around it and a temple as part of it.</seg>
<seg id="2815">22	327	I think they were in the breeder reactor.</seg>

<seg id="3057">45	363	Also interesting is again the plan: a rectangle with a temple on one end, dominating the space in front of it.</seg>
<seg id="3058">18	249	If you're the 82nd caller, you win a $50 gift certificate to harville's caramels, Seattle's finest candy store.</seg>
<seg id="3059">37	917	You could make her change her mind if you wanted to.</seg>
<seg id="3060">22	488	Jacks here. - Try a high filter.</seg>
<seg id="3061">1	79	No one's tasking me sales and marketing and location.</seg>
<seg id="3062">8	111	Ah, yes, please, - Yes, yes, yes,</seg>
<seg id="3063">16	349	Well, I just think... if we're all gonna move on, we have to let each other go.</seg>
<seg id="3064">2	933	If I'm at a game -- a couple cokes, a bag of popcorn...</seg>
<seg id="3065">6	544	And then one day, not 10 years from now, Babylon with its deep water harbor,</seg>
<seg id="3066">47	117	So probably this decoration belongs to the later renovation of this particular structure.</seg>
<seg id="3067">6	513	Oh I wouldn't tax yourself your majesty, a few good nights rest will do it, but no wine, or...</seg>
<seg id="3068">35	28	Papa. just chill. l have to fix my dupatta.</seg>
<seg id="3069">29	564	I'll do it. There's no time. Just go!</seg>
<seg id="3070">21	803	Can you slow down just a tad?</seg>
<seg id="3071">18	620	I'm so not falling for that one again.</seg>
<seg id="3072">2	89	It wasn't intentional. It was the truth.</seg>
<seg id="3073">22	570	He's trying to lock on. These guys are going hot.</seg>
<seg id="3074">13	658	We can turn it on, walk around, do a little dance, make a sandwich.</seg>
<seg id="3075">37	447	Guess they know I'm from Lowa.</seg>
<seg id="3076">7	658	It's funny how when you're a kid, a day can last forever.</seg>
<seg id="3077">47	401	I want to take you quickly through the monument.</seg>
<seg id="3078">23	5	Ever since then, I've had this cosmic connection with Neil.</seg>
<seg id="3079">15	3	Together for 7 years but he's still like a child</seg>
<seg id="3080">20	556	That's Brett. - He's 1 5 minutes early!</seg>
<seg id="3081">31	227	l'm gonna go for the jeep. That's a bad idea, Bobby.</seg>
<seg id="3082">1	226	And she starts to have all these feelings,</seg>
<seg id="3083">7	234	...posters and notices for lost pets and lost dogs.</seg>
<seg id="3084">27	802	Darn clever, these Earthmen, wouldn't you say?</seg>
<seg id="3085">44	136	Again, European powers are putting things like borders there, boundaries, and that has nothing to do with the way that, particularly nomadic people--they don't have any sense of borders.</seg>
<seg id="3086">47	9	And a portrait that shows that Pompey the Great very much wanted to ally himself with Alexander the Great, because if you look at his very full head of hair, you can see that he wears it in the center, pushed up in a kind of pompadour which is a reference to the same kind of upsweep that was worn by Alexander the Great.</seg>
<seg id="3087">18	427	Josh needed my help, so I just asked myself, what would you do?</seg>
<seg id="3088">1	424	Lightly textured and gold delicious "little Miss Fix" is about an 11-year-old girl</seg>
<seg id="3089">9	84	I don't know. I'm just curious.</seg>
<seg id="3090">48	114	Then I went through bankruptcy. And lost my whole menagerie</seg>
<seg id="3091">24	141	Is it something that Ilithyia would favor?</seg>
<seg id="3092">47	338	Keep this figure in your mind, because I'm going to show you another seated Roma very soon.</seg>
<seg id="3093">42	189	Parentco has a particularly attractive subsidiary.</seg>
<seg id="3094">5	334	Are you worried about me now?</seg>
<seg id="3095">33	289	I want this entire swamp searched! - Yes, sir.</seg>
<seg id="3096">32	461	So, um, all this moving from school to school...</seg>
<seg id="3097">14	475	Take the phone. Take the keys. Go!</seg>
<seg id="3098">46	252	But with the other hand what's most important, she has her hand behind her back and she's about to bring a whip, which you can see, down on the back of one of the initiates.</seg>
<seg id="3099">15	347	Her grandpa and grandma were beaten to death. It's a family tragedy</seg>
<seg id="3100">46	38	And then what you see in plan here are actually windows, rather than additional doorways.</seg>
<seg id="3101">27	250	We must get our communicators, contact the ship.</seg>
<seg id="3102">46	400	I think, this particular still life painting.</seg>
<seg id="3103">46	51	and above that another, a course that represents, in paint, what looks like variegated marble</seg>
<seg id="3104">50	227	You, who're afraid of cute puppies and wants to be a vet, are weirder.</seg>
<seg id="3105">17	66	Thanks. - Let me see that.</seg>
<seg id="3106">38	8	A great job, still best friends with the guys I grew up with, and in love with a beautiful girl,</seg>
<seg id="3107">33	444	And I guess he was. - Guess he was.</seg>
<seg id="3108">15	646	No, let me take you to a doctor</seg>
<seg id="3109">16	330	Here's an idea: Mom could actually make something.</seg>
<seg id="3110">1	332	I do. You did. Credit where credit's due.</seg>
<seg id="3111">11	21	I grew up learning about the family members that escaped the Holocaust...</seg>
<seg id="3112">24	589	Perhaps solonius will be available next year.</seg>
<seg id="3113">14	613	Then you completely shut her out of a test that she's crammed for...</seg>
<seg id="3114">34	700	Wait! Can I...can I just stay a little longer?</seg>
<seg id="3115">29	486	Major Sheppard would effectively be in suspended animation for the entire time.</seg>
<seg id="3116">6	92	You have no fear, it's fitting, a man searches for a woman at birth stop,</seg>
<seg id="3117">44	230	The tendency is to say, looking back, "Well, they're taking it out on animals, blowing the hell out of them and indigenous people, etc.etc."</seg>
<seg id="3118">22	383	I'll get back to you as soon as I can, okay?</seg>
<seg id="3119">33	387	They say it's the only game where a black man can wave a stick...</seg>
<seg id="3120">22	675	There is another container in the truck.</seg>
<seg id="3121">20	52	Sure. - What do you want?</seg>
<seg id="3122">47	112	The closest thing probably to it is something like, for those of you who know it--Botticelli's Primavera in Florence is probably sort of the idea here for emerging from the waters, and her depiction in this particular pediment above.</seg>
<seg id="3123">24	491	The aphrodisiac presence of my beautiful wife!</seg>
<seg id="3124">7	1171	Here, give me $25 back.     -Twenty-five.</seg>
<seg id="3125">50	183	Shit, he's no help to my life at all.</seg>
<seg id="3126">14	129	Though the much-lauded risotto was perfectly fine...</seg>
<seg id="3127">11	607	...To change that whiIst I am here.</seg>
<seg id="3128">7	648	Carol Gerber?   -That's right.</seg>
<seg id="3129">47	183	What happens in the end of the reign of Caesar?</seg>
<seg id="3130">18	500	One, I think you've had way too much caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="3131">7	860	Don't worry, I won't let the bogeyman get you.</seg>
<seg id="3132">22	568	We have clearance from the Russian government.</seg>
<seg id="3133">31	288	...our strike could provoke a counterattack.</seg>
<seg id="3134">47	258	But initially the Forum of Caesar would have stood exactly next to the Forum of Augustus.</seg>
<seg id="3135">44	323	Under the austral sky. From the south and the north, they'll come forth. At the sound of the mother's cry. And each at his post where the danger is most. Will stand as a sentry then</seg>
<seg id="3136">46	413	So what is this still life painting?</seg>
<seg id="3137">53	410	He is, he is you think? There's only one Santa, right?</seg>
<seg id="3138">45	527	They've placed the bathing block in the center.</seg>
<seg id="3139">18	97	So, who signed up for the Declan prom extravaganza?</seg>
<seg id="3140">31	41	...there'lI be no further military action conducted...</seg>
<seg id="3141">43	34	If I fall into it, it'll drive me crazy...</seg>
<seg id="3142">31	479	...indicating the cloud was approximately four kilometers from the border area between North Korea and China</seg>
<seg id="3143">16	359	I don't want to hear about Latn Ok or their experiments or how I was locked in a tank.</seg>
<seg id="3144">2	552	We're proud to be presenting our 30-second commercial for the at&t mobile tv and flo tv.</seg>
<seg id="3145">11	456	No one got hurt, I hope.</seg>
<seg id="3146">23	223	This shirt was worn by Neil in concert.</seg>
<seg id="3147">44	264	So, nature remains a part of this.</seg>
<seg id="3148">24	71	This drought has stretched our resources thin</seg>
<seg id="3149">27	489	This light could be a little higher.</seg>
<seg id="3150">53	433	I have to lick the lid</seg>
<seg id="3151">35	200	Laughter. color. light and sound marriage has come to town</seg>
<seg id="3152">53	512	Coke and orange and... CC Lemon</seg>
<seg id="3153">14	463	Oh, jeez. This was such a bad sleeping idea.</seg>
<seg id="3154">16	164	Why did Zzyzx order my termination?</seg>
<seg id="3155">33	157	People down here feel some things are worth killing for.</seg>
<seg id="3156">19	542	You better eat Iots of red bean porridge to stop hallucinating.</seg>
<seg id="3157">13	429	No, but she's got a birthday coming up soon.</seg>
<seg id="3158">25	156	so what happens to me after this?</seg>
<seg id="3159">20	250	In the third grade she told everybody it was Leia, like Princess Leia.</seg>
<seg id="3160">42	46	It was a sensory hallucination brought on by your aneurysm.</seg>
<seg id="3161">1	316	I don't want to be responsible for all the marketing in this project.</seg>
<seg id="3162">7	1085	Just find the queen of hearts.</seg>
<seg id="3163">30	598	But Liz will be there for you</seg>
<seg id="3164">14	708	Maybe all this time I'm thinking it's all for Rory...</seg>
<seg id="3165">8	140	What? - No, I mean, I'm a boy, of course,</seg>
<seg id="3166">23	563	Just have lunch with Sandy. What's it gonna hurt?</seg>
<seg id="3167">13	199	I just want to be sure that I see... something.</seg>
<seg id="3168">47	358	So as you looked at the temple, you would have seen Mars Ultor in the center of the pediment.</seg>
<seg id="3169">30	8	I have learned that milk helps your bones</seg>
<seg id="3170">12	135	...and entered the same train that she went on.</seg>
<seg id="3171">16	433	He had to live with that possibility, that fear.</seg>
<seg id="3172">29	242	We tried to cut it off when we were back on the planet</seg>
<seg id="3173">46	169	as she tries to escape, the breeze is caught in that, and it almost serves the purpose of a kind of parachute that's about to rescue her from whatever it is that she has seen and that has frightened her.</seg>
<seg id="3174">43	464	You know I'm a crazy motherfucker.</seg>
<seg id="3175">24	482	Move hamilcar up to fill the void.</seg>
<seg id="3176">1	983	I'm not trying -- Brandy was doing her makeup by the mirror.</seg>
<seg id="3177">40	379	At least, not after one of my associates stepped forward to take the plaintiff's case, effectively allowing me to seal it behind-- what's it called again?</seg>
<seg id="3178">14	329	I know a "D" seems pretty dismal... - Rory got a "D"?</seg>
<seg id="3179">1	859	I've been watching you and I've respected you. I'm sorry.</seg>
<seg id="3180">44	135	cattle herders who were in the center of what would become the German colonial territory.</seg>
<seg id="3181">16	446	Do you really think you're fooling anybody?</seg>
<seg id="3182">20	315	No, let me do this. I don't know how or why, but somehow I can see your sister's spirit.</seg>
<seg id="3183">2	215	Brandy was in charge of the presentation,</seg>
<seg id="3184">22	529	Mikhail? I need to ask you a question.</seg>
<seg id="3185">17	110	It was my birthday this week, and it's all systems go from my parents and the state of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="3186">22	528	Nerves? - That is all it is, Amanda.</seg>
<seg id="3187">39	515	of going blind twice in one lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="3188">5	451	If I die, and am reborn as a human, please let me meet Yon-hwa again.</seg>
<seg id="3189">42	472	Dr. Stone, true or false-- your father was an alcoholic.</seg>
<seg id="3190">16	284	You try to go on and smile like everything's back to normal, but...</seg>
<seg id="3191">45	400	And that does still exist now, or part of it does still exist.</seg>
<seg id="3192">23	190	Oh, I get it. You want me to go down on you.</seg>
<seg id="3193">45	286	And, most interestingly, we see the Colossus, which was clearly still standing also in the third century A. D.</seg>
<seg id="3194">11	197	But this bill is under an enormously important vote...</seg>
<seg id="3195">32	653	We paid you a substantial amount.</seg>
<seg id="3196">22	189	What look would that be, the one you saw in the inquiry?</seg>
<seg id="3197">8	137	Oh, okay, Selenielles, So how old does that make me?</seg>
<seg id="3198">44	303	The idea of these mountain men--now the mountain men get uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="3199">20	574	Go confirm with him. We'll wait right here.</seg>
<seg id="3200">11	321	...Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.</seg>
<seg id="3201">23	925	Oh, my God. It's so much worse than I thought.</seg>
<seg id="3202">46	144	He is playing a lyre, as you can see here, and probably singing, along with his lyre playing.</seg>
<seg id="3203">45	115	And I think you can see that much better in this particular detail, where you can again see the entire pilaster behind the rusticated masonry.</seg>
<seg id="3204">20	531	Because someday, trust me, I'm gonna need help movin' a body.</seg>
<seg id="3205">51	130	Tell you what. While I'm cooking...</seg>
<seg id="3206">2	738	At the beginning of the commercial.</seg>
<seg id="3207">28	535	I don't think he'll give us away.</seg>
<seg id="3208">14	465	I'm late! I woke up late! - Rory, calm down.</seg>
<seg id="3209">45	208	the groin vault or the ribbed vault.</seg>
<seg id="3210">53	351	Anyway, it'll grow right back out don't act so cool you look cute</seg>
<seg id="3211">21	252	The dog scored higher than I did.</seg>
<seg id="3212">35	101	I'm telling you. she'll give us all a bad name.</seg>
<seg id="3213">25	2	All my years upon this desolate island, void of all hope of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="3214">23	576	Damn! That was my favorite jacket.</seg>
<seg id="3215">14	461	No. I'm not even tired. I was just thinking of you.</seg>
<seg id="3216">8	242	Maltazard the Bountiful, He Who Watches and Protects,</seg>
<seg id="3217">30	43	Seems to be the Eid Milad Saeed</seg>
<seg id="3218">11	501	The evidence was gathered from people outside Sudan.</seg>
<seg id="3219">17	481	And we know that you've spoken to Mr. Taylor.</seg>
<seg id="3220">7	263	I do know that he said I must be some lucky kid...</seg>
<seg id="3221">1	553	Sitting there watching, "uh, uh, uh."</seg>
<seg id="3222">27	186	You're speaking to the Party Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="3223">18	31	It's amazing how much you look like Adam.</seg>
<seg id="3224">15	443	Next time smoke. Your mouth stinks</seg>
<seg id="3225">23	366	Mail, check. Go. Don't look back.</seg>
<seg id="3226">37	122	He's still a bit confused so he'll probably think that I already changed it today, but just ignore that.</seg>
<seg id="3227">37	606	Like when you were using them to impersonate Mick Hucknall from Simply Red.</seg>
<seg id="3228">14	371	Honey, you once told me that you loved Saved By the Bell.</seg>
<seg id="3229">23	511	No. She won't be able to because you'll be wearing this.</seg>
<seg id="3230">37	824	Tony fucked up. Sid fucked up.</seg>
<seg id="3231">45	410	he took a whole host of other items from the Temple, and he brought them back to Rome as trophies.</seg>
<seg id="3232">23	244	Old Ethel. We've been through a lot of games together.</seg>
<seg id="3233">2	205	I can't rely on her for anything substantial,</seg>
<seg id="3234">21	22	And then I can keep my job. Which would help my self-esteem.</seg>
<seg id="3235">2	201	It was literally, "I'm hearing what you're saying, but I don't care."</seg>
<seg id="3236">42	259	I didn't do anything wrong, Eli.</seg>
<seg id="3237">35	167	Just ask. and you shall have it this is your moment. grab it your wish is our command</seg>
<seg id="3238">2	540	It was hard. It was hard to take in.</seg>
<seg id="3239">43	342	What are you doing here, at this hour?</seg>
<seg id="3240">27	396	if you'd been Nazi spies. Leave us.</seg>
<seg id="3241">19	507	Dog Nose! - Who wants to go first?</seg>
<seg id="3242">6	578	Wait, wait, vultures, wait, my son alexander...</seg>
<seg id="3243">5	339	It's the first time I've ever held a living person's hand.</seg>
<seg id="3244">46	40	This is a view of Room 5 as it looks today.</seg>
<seg id="3245">7	56	...a life insurance policy that lapsed before he died.</seg>
<seg id="3246">51	27	...well some people are just bad. They're not worth the trouble.</seg>
<seg id="3247">37	164	Is it possible to truly enjoy power?</seg>
<seg id="3248">47	64	The Julian family traced its ancestry back to Venus via Aeneas, through Aeneas.</seg>
<seg id="3249">21	690	Do you think there's a chance that... -What?</seg>
<seg id="3250">54	457	Hey, cuddy, you know any rodeo clowns who can weigh in</seg>
<seg id="3251">42	640	Finding out you were just throwing my dad</seg>
<seg id="3252">42	448	That's why I became the U. N.O. S.Coordinator at st. Vincent'S.</seg>
<seg id="3253">35	38	ls that his name? l completely forgot. groom is bringing guest from England.</seg>
<seg id="3254">47	472	It was located over here, along the ancient Via Flaminia, the street that Augustus took when he returned from Spain and Gaul.</seg>
<seg id="3255">45	13	So these men, also great architectural innovators.</seg>
<seg id="3256">39	365	But remember, you and i wouldn't be standing here talking right now...</seg>
<seg id="3257">25	153	So tell me, this ship that brought you to the island, where's the wreck?</seg>
<seg id="3258">3	445	It's not Dragon Ma. It's entirely our own fault.</seg>
<seg id="3259">17	485	Was he calling because you don't want to stay?</seg>
<seg id="3260">14	193	So, this guy asked about you today. - What guy?</seg>
<seg id="3261">47	277	You can see that it's made out of tufa.</seg>
<seg id="3262">20	114	It's terrible. They're trying to get my sister to sign papers authorizing permission to take me off of life support.</seg>
<seg id="3263">47	7	It's a quite realistic portrait with the lines and wrinkles, with his receding hairline and so on accentuated in this portrait.</seg>
<seg id="3264">28	464	Maybe Sheppard and Teyla don't even need rescuing any more.</seg>
<seg id="3265">1	757	You lied to me, and you shouldn't have done that.</seg>
<seg id="3266">28	8	I see the similarity now, you're right! Yeah, it's great!</seg>
<seg id="3267">35	512	A really sharp mind and a very big heart l just want a man not scared to weep to hold me close when we're asleep</seg>
<seg id="3268">28	73	It smells like I'm on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="3269">46	447	It purports to represent a very famous historical event, at least in terms of local history, and that is a brawl that broke out between the Pompeians and another group of individuals who lived in the area called the Nucerians, N-u-c-e-r-i-a-n-s.</seg>
<seg id="3270">35	331	Well. l don't want you turning India into a theme park.</seg>
<seg id="3271">7	758	Lost Horizon, magic and places unknown.</seg>
<seg id="3272">29	143	We're going with the assumption, that it was one or both of the drive pods.</seg>
<seg id="3273">15	101	Come on, have one. Help yourself</seg>
<seg id="3274">23	604	No problem. We were happy to act as witnesses on your behalf.</seg>
<seg id="3275">5	267	Don't lie to me. You deceived me.</seg>
<seg id="3276">17	166	It's formulas, equations. You can learn that yourself.</seg>
<seg id="3277">44	462	There was an enormous, enormous national funeral service in London in which millions of people saw at least parts of it.</seg>
<seg id="3278">35	47	From one of the richest families in America.</seg>
<seg id="3279">44	79	It's represented best by Fashoda, at the end of the 1890s, where a British force stumbles into a French force in the middle of Sudan and they say nasty things to each other, finally toast each other with what drinks they had brought along and their countries almost go to war, because the flag would be tarnished by losing out to the craven reptiles that you just stumbled into in the Sudan.</seg>
<seg id="3280">30	444	Hello, you should really close this section</seg>
<seg id="3281">20	322	We'll get her to rip those papers... - Get the hell outta here, you freak!</seg>
<seg id="3282">37	621	No, Chris. She had to go for a wazz.</seg>
<seg id="3283">30	661	This is clear, but I wonder if you will feel a sense of the various</seg>

<seg id="4215">23	753	I mean, not that it matters now but if I had asked you out back in high school, would you have gone?</seg>
<seg id="4216">19	499	That's funny. Selling her so he can have someone else?</seg>
<seg id="4217">2	502	Get everybody in here the at&t mobile TV and Flo TV.</seg>
<seg id="4218">1	677	So what was the stumble, Steuart?</seg>
<seg id="4219">7	1190	Hi-ho, Silver!    -Bobby, how was school?</seg>
<seg id="4220">1	1043	I don't think it's being disloyal</seg>
<seg id="4221">9	405	Come on. Come on my friend.</seg>
<seg id="4222">7	673	Your father didn't leave us well-off.</seg>
<seg id="4223">46	259	She is in the lap, in part, of a woman who seems to protect her, or try to protect her.</seg>
<seg id="4224">15	469	Let's start all over again and be a match, Okay?</seg>
<seg id="4225">54	170	she's a few years away from grasping sarcasm, don't you think?</seg>
<seg id="4226">35	163	It's not long before the day I up. up. up and fly away</seg>
<seg id="4227">35	113	Good Lord. Four daughters in one family. God has blessed you four times over.</seg>
<seg id="4228">6	454	To the jackals with ya Alexander...</seg>
<seg id="4229">45	271	They planted--they put trees that they probably--I don't know, real or fake trees, I'm not sure which;</seg>
<seg id="4230">8	155	Warn me if he comes this way,</seg>
<seg id="4231">22	651	Pull back. Pull back. Come on.</seg>
<seg id="4232">53	505	This one, huh? Let's do it, let's do it</seg>
<seg id="4233">7	386	Someplace not as nice as here, I think.</seg>
<seg id="4234">33	67	You gonna want your boy in on this? - Sheriff...</seg>
<seg id="4235">17	216	In your old apartment, I saw a picture.</seg>
<seg id="4236">24	623	In honor of the name Batiatus and the sacred Vulcanalia</seg>
<seg id="4237">45	450	An extremely well-preserved section of the decorative frieze of the Temple of Vespasian, the Temple of Divine Vespasian in Rome, which you see again dates to around 79 to 81 A. D.</seg>
<seg id="4238">50	404	I don't even know what landscape architecture is.</seg>
<seg id="4239">54	448	Or we never curedthe infection. - Are you saying she never had reye's?</seg>
<seg id="4240">22	164	The rebels came in and found the others, about five.</seg>
<seg id="4241">44	73	This, too, is part of social imperialism and is part of the idea that somehow social imperialism is economically determined.</seg>
<seg id="4242">25	883	Let me know when they get here.</seg>
<seg id="4243">29	496	Teyla. You said this creature was like a Wraith.</seg>
<seg id="4244">45	279	But it looks probably in antiquity quite a bit more like the awning that we saw in the painting in Pompeii that represented a characteristic awning for a Roman amphitheater.</seg>
<seg id="4245">14	484	Maybe it's downstairs in the store? - Maybe. I just...</seg>
<seg id="4246">27	538	Isak just heard two security men.</seg>
<seg id="4247">43	228	Killing you, it's more fucked up.</seg>
<seg id="4248">5	235	If you go on like this, everyone will be killed in vain.</seg>
<seg id="4249">50	278	It's cold, huh? Did you go to the bathroom?</seg>
<seg id="4250">11	584	—I know my representatives. —There you go. There you go. Get them.</seg>
<seg id="4251">30	296	I'll tell you what I think Terry Bernard</seg>
<seg id="4252">21	586	This looks so real. I can't even see the buttons.</seg>
<seg id="4253">47	391	There are two possible precedents or two possible references that are being made here.</seg>
<seg id="4254">9	368	It's just total... purity of essence.</seg>
<seg id="4255">32	665	I can't do anything without that.</seg>
<seg id="4256">44	265	Again, to repeat, the cult of the American frontiersmen, let me say a little bit more about that, is part of this.</seg>
<seg id="4257">31	148	...they believe the DPRK wilI retaliate with artillery...</seg>
<seg id="4258">6	507	It was the worst blunder of his life,</seg>
<seg id="4259">46	86	And I wanted to point out, using this image, that again about how sophisticated this particular artist was, because he takes into consideration, as I mentioned before, the corners of the room, and they become part of the narrative.</seg>
<seg id="4260">8	44	I'm to succeed my father and watch over the Minimoy people until it shall come to pass that my own children reach the age of 1, 000 and succeed me,</seg>
<seg id="4261">2	217	And I was in charge of the editing.</seg>
<seg id="4262">47	305	How many of you think this is the Greek one?</seg>
<seg id="4263">31	364	...things wilI only get worse for my country.</seg>
<seg id="4264">13	253	Here are the words to the school song which must be recited upon demand.</seg>
<seg id="4265">29	508	John, are you sure you wanna do this?</seg>
<seg id="4266">11	185	...Through the state legislature and then signed by the governor.</seg>
<seg id="4267">6	279	This army, this army is your blomp boy.</seg>
<seg id="4268">15	128	Sir, I want a swap of partner. She's a bitch, sir</seg>
<seg id="4269">53	217	C'mon over, come over, c'mon over, yuki</seg>
<seg id="4270">5	454	Since you're human, you cannot follow me any more.</seg>
<seg id="4271">11	168	...Where he told the people that he had the power to kill whoever he wished in Darfur...</seg>
<seg id="4272">22	13	Talk to me. - We got the bogey on the run, sir.</seg>
<seg id="4273">3	107	We've done that ever since, we were little kids.</seg>
<seg id="4274">36	683	I'll follow as soon as l'm done here.</seg>
<seg id="4275">13	105	This is my daughter, Lorelai Gilmore, because I named her after me.</seg>
<seg id="4276">17	104	You must just rake in the tips.</seg>
<seg id="4277">8	132	Let's get this show on the road,</seg>
<seg id="4278">45	161	And what he did, smartly, was to say, "What I am going to do with this property?</seg>
<seg id="4279">9	532	I think it would be better if I looked for you. I could...</seg>
<seg id="4280">27	646	Our space fleet is on its way toward Zeon, both manned and unmanned weapons.</seg>
<seg id="4281">47	437	So again, interesting correspondences between painting and architectural decoration.</seg>
<seg id="4282">14	680	So I had a nice chat with Headmaster Charleston today.</seg>
<seg id="4283">1	1022	Yes. I have never lied, Mr. Trump!</seg>
<seg id="4284">1	92	Why would you even tell him that?</seg>
<seg id="4285">18	212	She doesn't want anyone to know she's still alive.</seg>
<seg id="4286">11	69	...I was struck by the similarities to what's happening in Darfur.</seg>
<seg id="4287">47	124	And most importantly what this restored view shows you is the relationship between the Temple of Venus Genetrix and Caesar's Forum, and the Capitolium, on the top of the Capitoline Hill.</seg>
<seg id="4288">7	1129	Yes, that's it! Okay.     -All right!</seg>
<seg id="4289">24	251	What could he offer a man who seeks neither fame nor glory.</seg>
<seg id="4290">2	1007	But you're the project manager, and you have to say</seg>
<seg id="4291">19	134	Mr. Jung Pil- soo. Why are you moving that?</seg>
<seg id="4292">2	157	Is to make sure that your message is clear and concise.</seg>
<seg id="4293">42	643	I didn't think razy enough to say anything to my father</seg>
<seg id="4294">21	331	I mean, you yelled at me. You were up-front, and honest...</seg>
<seg id="4295">2	265	The photographer was there with all his crew.</seg>
<seg id="4296">51	2	A chance for a better life.</seg>
<seg id="4297">23	656	Can't you see I'm in mourning?</seg>
<seg id="4298">28	62	I know you understand... you'll do what's right.</seg>
<seg id="4299">8	161	Your wish is my command, Princess,</seg>
<seg id="4300">45	545	And the ones that did include--and let me just compare, as the last image, compare the octagonal room, an axonometric view of the octagonal room, with the Baths of Titus in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="4301">1	1028	And stop screaming with -- with my name in vain?</seg>
<seg id="4302">28	445	Yeah, I tried once with a mirror. Couldn't quite reach.</seg>
<seg id="4303">31	48	...both reporting troop strengths at over 85 percent.</seg>
<seg id="4304">15	672	Each time I switched on the washer you secretly put your bird cage into it for washing</seg>
<seg id="4305">27	606	Get that light over there, please.</seg>
<seg id="4306">12	205	...let me just say it's not an engagement ring...</seg>
<seg id="4307">15	109	Hips will look bigger in a wedding gown</seg>
<seg id="4308">32	89	I know. - I -- you know what?</seg>
<seg id="4309">53	90	You're the one that has to promise hardest</seg>
<seg id="4310">22	458	What about these Americans? Did they make contact?</seg>
<seg id="4311">18	91	Yeah, not to sound too mom or anything, but I don't think you need to break the bank to have a great time at prom.</seg>
<seg id="4312">15	692	Enough. Li and you don't match anyway</seg>
<seg id="4313">23	843	But once you take your final vows, there is no going back.</seg>
<seg id="4314">3	187	It's all right. I am patient. I can wait.</seg>
<seg id="4315">16	259	Use our frequent flyer miles and catch a flight to Seattle</seg>
<seg id="4316">31	193	This thing is totally out of hand!</seg>
<seg id="4317">36	14	It's no picnic, but I've learned to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="4318">39	94	He's out with a dreadful flu- or so he says.</seg>
<seg id="4319">11	142	It is not about religion, it is not about ethnicity...</seg>
<seg id="4320">36	688	So you don't remember anything at all?</seg>
<seg id="4321">23	215	Hey, Judith. Can I give you the grand tour?</seg>
<seg id="4322">45	244	They also show you that much of what was once there is no longer there, in the interior of the structure.</seg>
<seg id="4323">22	220	...And then get out before anyone knows we're there.</seg>
<seg id="4324">23	408	Great. Great. I just moved back to town.</seg>
<seg id="4325">21	332	...And you called me out on all my crap.</seg>
<seg id="4326">9	256	Here. This is where they keep the days reserve cash. Okay fuck that.</seg>
<seg id="4327">29	36	We don't know but we can't get it off him, and we tried everything</seg>
<seg id="4328">17	350	357 magnum, about 5, 000 horsepower?</seg>
<seg id="4329">24	272	Your master's hand has been at work.</seg>
<seg id="4330">18	602	You just bought yourself a DJ.</seg>
<seg id="4331">28	239	Something has to have kept Colonel Sheppard from shooting you all this time!</seg>
<seg id="4332">27	280	I don't care if you hit the broad side of a barn.</seg>
<seg id="4333">18	378	You could've left it for me.</seg>
<seg id="4334">46	339	It doesn't mean that there might not have been others, but I think it probably means that there weren't a lot of others, that this was truly an exceptional work of art, that is preserved in the Villa of the Mysteries at Pompeii.</seg>
<seg id="4335">39	76	That's impossible, Danny. You're a Valdessecchi.</seg>
<seg id="4336">47	221	Mars Ultor, U-l-t-o-r, Mars Ultor, Mars the Avenger, in gratitude for helping him avenge the death of Julius Caesar, the murder of Julius Caesar, the assassination of Julius Caesar.</seg>
<seg id="4337">12	379	He just wants his property back.</seg>
<seg id="4338">54	77	The rest of them are probablyhiding out in her gall bladder. Do an ultrasound.</seg>
<seg id="4339">46	286	She has an attendant standing next to her, and then there's a small winged cupid at the left, and then across the corner we see another cupid, standing on a base, leaning on a pedestal, winged again, his head resting on one of his hands, and he is looking across the corner at what is going on, on the other side.</seg>
<seg id="4340">45	23	We're going to see a certain move back toward a conservative vision, but we're also going to see that Nero's innovations live on, and that's the most exciting piece of this particular Flavian puzzle, as we shall see.</seg>
<seg id="4341">54	150	All I want is a secondopinion before-- - no time!</seg>
<seg id="4342">46	223	The fact that we see Dionysus in this state and also on the lap of Ariadne is interesting, especially the lap of Ariadne.</seg>
<seg id="4343">42	335	Do we have to go through this again, Taylor?</seg>
<seg id="4344">21	528	Well, hello there. Now, don't tell me...</seg>

<seg id="4352">31	281	I don't care what the president of South Korea is willing to do.</seg>
<seg id="4353">12	133	...but it's quite possible, and that's why I'm here...</seg>
<seg id="4354">1	772	One of the best comebacks I've seen</seg>
<seg id="4355">13	247	They just take up space and screw up the curve.</seg>
<seg id="4356">41	259	Oh, they're my trial binders-- pleadings, precedent, deposition transcripts, and scientific studies color-coded and cross-indexed.</seg>
<seg id="4357">28	347	The Wraith could show up at any minute.</seg>
<seg id="4358">23	373	He's cheating on you. -With two chicks.</seg>
<seg id="4359">23	661	When you go out with Sandy.</seg>
<seg id="4360">37	251	Mostly we're just happy that Chris is all right. OK, Cass?</seg>
<seg id="4361">42	28	Well, I imagine the only way for bad nurse Carrie to restore the sexy amnesiac's lost memory with a good, old-fashioned</seg>
<seg id="4362">13	611	What? - Right in the head.</seg>
<seg id="4363">54	523	Well, I see what you meanabout house pokingin the right spot.</seg>
<seg id="4364">12	187	I just wanted a picture of you.</seg>
<seg id="4365">47	259	We see that here, and if you look carefully you can see the remains of the Temple of Mars Ultor, as well as a precinct wall that is preserved.</seg>

<seg id="4372">45	512	the caldarium, hot room, with an apse and a cold water splash basin;</seg>

<seg id="4375">21	730	But she's a witch. -Yes, and?</seg>
<seg id="4376">2	328	Today, time was definitely not our friend.</seg>

<seg id="4389">2	150	That gets people excited about at&t mobile tv</seg>
<seg id="4390">28	379	Now, I'm heading back to the Jumper and you're welcome to join me.</seg>
<seg id="4391">39	203	Why-Why would you want to ruin that? Huh?</seg>
<seg id="4392">39	135	But you know what I like most about you?</seg>
<seg id="4393">20	64	No. - She was against it.</seg>
<seg id="4394">46	399	for those of you who enjoy modern art, for example, I think you'll agree that this is- tends to be as modern as Roman Art gets, because we see it has a very contemporary appearance,</seg>
<seg id="4395">23	381	Thanks for meeting me here. I have something important to say.</seg>
<seg id="4396">36	385	Your full name is Charlene Elizabeth Baltimore.</seg>
<seg id="4397">32	117	There's nothing you can do that would ever change the way I feel.</seg>
<seg id="4398">46	242	But it seems to be the covering, in this particular case, and possibly about to reveal the secret--the most important secret item in this cult.</seg>
<seg id="4399">1	702	Let me ask you this. I want to invest, right?</seg>
<seg id="4400">1	35	Dave is the most classless, schizophrenic human I have ever met in my life.</seg>

<seg id="4405">42	92	I think we can make the law journals with this one.</seg>
<seg id="4406">3	310	Help me lock them up first.</seg>
<seg id="4407">16	432	You mean he expected to be killed?</seg>
<seg id="4408">45	525	It's roughly rectangular, as you can see, and unlike the Stabian Baths at Pompeii, where you have the bath complex on the right side, you can see that the rooms that are used for bathing are at the center of the plan, which makes sense from the Roman standpoint.</seg>
<seg id="4409">32	200	You're so eager to become the child's friend...</seg>
<seg id="4410">22	521	...Not considering your past relationship with him.</seg>

<seg id="4894">14	144	For our top story tonight, a grisly, horrible thing happened in a small town...</seg>
<seg id="4895">16	399	They'll come after you. - I won't let them find me.</seg>
<seg id="4896">1	488	She really can't do much of anything.</seg>
<seg id="4897">22	92	Are they still alive? - We're not sure.</seg>
<seg id="4898">16	204	Everything's cool - No major damage? - It was quite dull, actually</seg>
<seg id="4899">11	549	But when you find something that...</seg>
<seg id="4900">21	52	Why didn't you tell me? This is great news.</seg>
<seg id="4901">28	314	Anyway, I think he was looking for the guy.</seg>
<seg id="4902">20	370	You're asking the wrong question. - Why is that wrong?</seg>
<seg id="4903">47	88	We can see that there is--well I'll show you this in a moment, but take my word--it has a high podium;it has a deep porch; it has freestanding columns in that porch.</seg>
<seg id="4904">15	563	You, too. You changed it for me?</seg>
<seg id="4905">36	326	Who knew I had an old fiance?</seg>
<seg id="4906">31	396	Sir, First Squad penetrates hostile airspace...</seg>
<seg id="4907">12	227	How can I put this delicately?</seg>
<seg id="4908">11	649	Our greatest asset will be our ability as a race, the human race...</seg>
<seg id="4909">21	420	It's really funny. We'd like to get it in a little earlier.</seg>
<seg id="4910">52	606	It's mature. I don't know if it's "mature."</seg>
<seg id="4911">17	573	It's not always easy to know what that is or where it will lead us.</seg>
<seg id="4912">11	270	Good job, we'll take it from here.</seg>
<seg id="4913">26	355	the skull of your friend Crusoe, once the vultures have picked it clean.</seg>
<seg id="4914">31	352	l'm afraid we we have to assume that they have been compromised.</seg>
<seg id="4915">45	341	And it's interesting to see that it was that same plan, that idea of a great open rectangular space, with a temple as part of it, that was used</seg>
<seg id="4916">22	74	The Asian is John Lee Kim.</seg>
<seg id="4917">7	247	Mom, Ted-- I mean, Mr. Brautigan...</seg>
<seg id="4918">15	72	Piglet, your hat's twisted, adjust it</seg>
<seg id="4919">12	32	You like that? That's good. So...</seg>
<seg id="4920">18	395	This is the best thing that's ever happened to me.</seg>
<seg id="4921">35	606	So Mr. Darcy didn't manage to seduce the jewel of Amritsar?</seg>
<seg id="4922">53	241	And also, mother won't be coming back for a while</seg>
<seg id="4923">14	404	The bard with a beard. Love it.</seg>
<seg id="4924">29	488	If the creature reacted that violently to drops of water, who knows how it would react to Stargate travel.</seg>
<seg id="4925">46	333	I put on your Monument List, you'll see an image, a drawing of all of these scenes that I've now gone through, in order, and I think it's helpful for you to have that as a reference, just to be able to follow along again the narrative and where each of the scenes that we've described comes up.</seg>
<seg id="4926">22	16	Which way, Rodgers? - Cannot identify, sir.</seg>
<seg id="4927">33	64	You down here to help us solve our nigger problems?</seg>
<seg id="4928">35	641	Lakhi's decided she wants to show me the town tonight.</seg>

<seg id="4932">15	115	Damned Four Eyes, I must beat you up What are you doing?</seg>
<seg id="4933">18	565	This time, you're the pretty one.</seg>
<seg id="4934">46	328	And so we see underground rooms, underground buildings being built for this purpose</seg>
<seg id="4935">11	109	We've always talked about the fact that we need to all try to improve the planet.</seg>
<seg id="4936">8	359	I like this kid, What is this favor?</seg>
<seg id="4937">9	333	Ricardo, what I was telling you was...</seg>
<seg id="4938">18	139	You owe me a buck fifteen.</seg>
<seg id="4939">15	44	She took everything! Doesn't she deserve a beating?</seg>
<seg id="4940">44	90	Or they thought that maybe the British and the Russians would fight because they're rivals in what was called the "Great Game" for north of India, and Afghanistan, and all of that.</seg>
<seg id="4941">11	335	...That they cannot do so with impunity.</seg>
<seg id="4942">1	264	Did you get the e-mail? Yeah.</seg>
<seg id="4943">13	236	That means she's going out for the school paper.</seg>
<seg id="4944">32	645	An idea that I tried to write dracoban.</seg>
<seg id="4945">20	288	Actually, I just want to beg you to... to give her a little bit more time.</seg>
<seg id="4946">43	469	No, after I kill both of you,</seg>
<seg id="4947">36	602	You and Mr. Outdoors bump pelvises? - It's possible.</seg>
<seg id="4948">16	80	Okay, here's the deal. Mom and dad really need this trip, so you can't do anything to stress them out while they're away</seg>
<seg id="4949">24	104	And Barca became the beast of carthage.</seg>
<seg id="4950">10	360	Who? - My daughter. She ran away</seg>
<seg id="4951">18	445	Wasn't it about celebrating the times you've had with your friends?</seg>
<seg id="4952">19	160	Why did you go to jail? You knifed someone.</seg>
<seg id="4953">27	510	This takes too long to explain.</seg>
<seg id="4954">51	346	A date? - Yeah, why not?</seg>
<seg id="4955">22	634	This is it. They're being kept inside.</seg>
<seg id="4956">27	213	When the hour is up, you will die most unpleasantly, I promise you!</seg>
<seg id="4957">10	409	Maybe you don't see her? You just hear her. - You're scaring him.</seg>
<seg id="4958">14	330	Yeah, but... - She's never gotten a "D.</seg>
<seg id="4959">13	252	Here's the rules of the school and the Chilton Honor Code.</seg>
<seg id="4960">53	341	You can put your things inside, and do that...</seg>
<seg id="4961">1	286	It's about a girl from a very wealthy family,</seg>
<seg id="4962">8	366	Using your mirrors, Mino, Mirrors, - Oh, yes, m-m-m-mirrors, - That's enough,</seg>
<seg id="4963">24	234	To surrender in the arena...I cannot do.</seg>
<seg id="4964">45	384	A quite severe fade, as it seems, with a number of entranceways.</seg>
<seg id="4965">45	543	The Domus Aurea no longer stood, to be studied.</seg>
<seg id="4966">42	61	Patti, I told you why I did what I did.</seg>
<seg id="4967">13	258	For that, you have to go to the nurse or Coach Rubens.</seg>
<seg id="4968">17	217	A woman and a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="4969">13	622	I was told to look for a ceramic frog with a key in it.</seg>
<seg id="4970">20	136	Please don't! - Don't worry. I'm a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="4971">51	10	Why don't you retire and come work with me in paradise, huh?</seg>
<seg id="4972">1	280	And shrink it down into a really short time frame</seg>
<seg id="4973">14	281	Ms. Gilmore? - Where is the test?</seg>
<seg id="4974">27	564	Yes. A doctor should have more pride.</seg>
<seg id="4975">23	353	Fifty bucks for you, and 200 for your friend.</seg>
<seg id="4976">39	495	You think you could do that? - Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="4977">23	1079	Sandy, hi. Look, I can-- Darren. Sorry.</seg>
<seg id="4978">28	29	Looked like bullets, but it's hard to say. The guy was a mess.</seg>
<seg id="4979">14	108	Okay, just a minute. - I've got it.</seg>
<seg id="4980">1	341	I think it's gonna be really left up to the four of us to maybe go in and introduce a scene and say, "okay, you know, Nan is very obsessive-compulsive.</seg>
<seg id="4981">14	381	It's worse. It's like a "G" or a "W".</seg>
<seg id="4982">30	135	Fuck you, I've stabbed me, man</seg>
<seg id="4983">45	460	If we look at the objects, we see that they are mainly objects that are used in ritual sacrifice.</seg>
<seg id="4984">8	435	It's noon, , in one minute,</seg>
<seg id="4985">46	16	We also have looked--in fact, I want to return at the beginning of today's presentation to the Villa of the Mysteries in Pompeii.</seg>
<seg id="4986">8	18	Oh, rats, This map's a total washout,</seg>
<seg id="4987">47	447	I show you a view from Google Earth, an aerial view, showing the Mausoleum of Augustus, this large round tomb that we will look at on Thursday, showing a piazza around it, and showing, from the air, the Richard Meier Museum that has been built to enclose the Ara Pacis.</seg>
<seg id="4988">43	497	I'm not going back. So go back now.</seg>
<seg id="4989">20	518	He's flipping me off. - Are you flipping her off?</seg>
<seg id="4990">44	1	Prof: All right. I'm going to talk about imperialism today.</seg>
<seg id="4991">11	61	I guess every experience changes you.</seg>
<seg id="4992">32	155	We could chat for a bit.</seg>
<seg id="4993">27	796	What he's saying is that a man holds that much power, even with the best intentions,</seg>
<seg id="4994">46	364	And they take boulders, as you can see in this scene here, and they begin to attack the ships of Odysseus, destroying most of them, and only the one with Odysseus himself is able to escape, and he makes his way, at that point, to another island, to meet up with the enchantress Circe.</seg>
<seg id="4995">31	178	...then, yes, they prefer a preemptive attack.</seg>
<seg id="4996">46	224	Because again, she was his mortal--she herself was a mortal--his mortal lover.</seg>
<seg id="4997">1	771	And, David, that's an amazing comeback,</seg>
<seg id="4998">15	322	Yes. My wife is fussy. I'll slap her if she makes any noise again</seg>
<seg id="4999">23	825	But from now on, I'll take care of Judith myself.</seg>
<seg id="5000">27	395	If we'd taken you into our confidence, we could've betrayed all our people</seg>
<seg id="5001">18	375	But Jessi touched something inside of you.</seg>
<seg id="5002">16	365	No one whose mind worked like mine, who could experience the world the way that I did.</seg>
<seg id="5003">30	371	Changed the interface bones and blood group</seg>
<seg id="5004">46	301	The attendant also has a section of her hair in her hand, and the two of them together are trying to get her ready for her mystical marriage.</seg>
<seg id="5005">11	542	We ask today that Governor Schwarzenegger sign AB 2941 ...</seg>
<seg id="5006">12	229	Give me a break. I'm working my ass off.</seg>
<seg id="5007">30	338	It is a strong heart to him who gave you this</seg>
<seg id="5008">29	222	Feelings creeping me out. Look lieutenant</seg>
<seg id="5009">20	259	God knows she wasn't dating anybody. -Everybody likes to rub that one in.</seg>
<seg id="5010">45	344	We don't think it was actually used as a typical forum with shops and a law court and so on, but may have been used in a different way, and I'll speak to that in a moment.</seg>
<seg id="5011">2	386	She's been unable to secure a location,</seg>
<seg id="5012">44	308	Here's a verse, I can't remember where I got that.</seg>
<seg id="5013">11	638	...That California does not stand for murder and genocide.</seg>
<seg id="5014">35	467	But. as they say. "no life... without wife."</seg>
<seg id="5015">54	574	Get the hellout of my way. - No, I'm--unh!</seg>
<seg id="5016">51	134	So, Ray boy here, what happens?</seg>
<seg id="5017">2	863	No, no, no -- so, if you tell her to go get props for an office environment,</seg>
<seg id="5018">9	449	What... did you give me? - Nothing.</seg>
<seg id="5019">39	429	What's the matter with you, kid? - Sorry. Sorry. Didn't see you.</seg>
<seg id="5020">46	58	And those monumental figures tell a story, and it's a very interesting, very intriguing, very mysterious story indeed.</seg>
<seg id="5021">39	316	Danny, that's a window. - [Dr. Evans Laughs]</seg>
<seg id="5022">45	367	marble that was brought from other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="5023">2	925	And then you hide behind it.</seg>
<seg id="5024">24	185	I was born in this Ludus.</seg>
<seg id="5025">1	828	And you start talking about yourself. Because, Mr. Trump</seg>
<seg id="5026">23	678	Oh, great. They're making a fortune on the lnternet.</seg>
<seg id="5027">32	339	I think what's important right now to remember is that you need to learn stuff.</seg>
<seg id="5028">51	83	No they have. Yeah, they have.</seg>
<seg id="5029">22	711	If the missile hadn't diverted, the Kremlin would be in chaos.</seg>
<seg id="5030">45	278	but I guess that's a very Roman thing to do, so he did that.</seg>
<seg id="5031">23	1155	Hold on. -And did I mention I was gay?</seg>
<seg id="5032">3	402	Keep a low profile in Canton.</seg>
<seg id="5033">20	394	I'll call information, maybe she's listed.</seg>
<seg id="5034">33	88	Yes, I'm aware of that. - Well, lying just don't come into it.</seg>
<seg id="5035">2	299	I don't know. -Yeah, some of the actors have arrived.</seg>
<seg id="5036">28	69	or... the perfect place to be exposed to dangerously high levels of solar radiation!</seg>
<seg id="5037">53	225	Used to work at Haneda you know what haneda is? It's a place with Iotx of airplanes you know, right, Shigeru? That's where he used to work</seg>
<seg id="5038">7	17	l'll pull rabbits out of a hat.</seg>
<seg id="5039">41	20	That guy--he just got two live chickens through.</seg>
<seg id="5040">48	134	And now they're both supporting me. They're both supporting me</seg>
<seg id="5041">24	487	Whatever your thoughts, cast them out.</seg>
<seg id="5042">39	268	I'm here if you need me. - Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="5043">1	11	And the men had problems of their own.</seg>
<seg id="5044">27	370	I do not know if the circuits are correct, Captain.</seg>
<seg id="5045">8	259	Uh-uh, The version recorded in history books is slightly different,</seg>
<seg id="5046">14	437	The Comedy of Errors: Written? - 1590.</seg>
<seg id="5047">8	134	Selenia, it's, are you really going to be 1, 000 years old?</seg>
<seg id="5048">30	613	No, Liz, Liz, you know I love you</seg>
<seg id="5049">5	460	So-hwa went to fight them alone!</seg>
<seg id="5050">50	354	Come here! Is that what I taught you?</seg>
<seg id="5051">15	343	They're photos of my parents in their youth</seg>
<seg id="5052">14	229	Then they can feel good because they've been considerate enough to ask...</seg>
<seg id="5053">47	296	But I show it to you to make one point, and that is that it seems very likely that there was some interesting architectural exchange.</seg>
<seg id="5054">16	41	I've waited a long time to meet you Kyle</seg>
<seg id="5055">5	268	You said you can read minds, didn't you?</seg>
<seg id="5056">27	412	They imprisoned him. Melakon sentenced him to death.</seg>
<seg id="5057">9	280	Well... you could open it in five minutes?</seg>
<seg id="5058">1	706	You put your cards, you put your phone numbers,</seg>
<seg id="5059">2	387	So I have to re-enact an outdoor sports scene inside with a cheesy backdrop.</seg>
<seg id="5060">17	434	I know that you would be so good for Jessi.</seg>
<seg id="5061">23	477	I'm scared. What if we get caught? -Not gonna happen.</seg>
<seg id="5062">50	356	Come outside! - No, I won't go!</seg>
<seg id="5063">21	580	Wow. That's really cool. Did Props make that?</seg>
<seg id="5064">35	314	She's certainly read you like a book. Darcy.</seg>
<seg id="5065">39	20	There was one other girl I was thinking about setting you up with.</seg>
<seg id="5066">16	72	They resurrected the experiments in the 1950s, this time without Einstein and under tighter secrecy</seg>
<seg id="5067">28	278	Because the Wraith are coming. - How do you know?</seg>
<seg id="5068">45	127	It's mis-restored here; you have to imagine the two tiers that we just looked at before, not this sort of thing.</seg>
<seg id="5069">7	606	Have you ever heard of privacy?     -Sorry.</seg>
<seg id="5070">42	420	Oh, don't go yelling at her, Taylor. She didn't tell me.</seg>
<seg id="5071">7	1182	Yeah, but maybe it's a secret code.</seg>
<seg id="5072">47	30	In his biography of Julius Caesar, the writer Suetonius, who was a secretary and a biographer to the emperor Hadrian in the second century A. D.</seg>
<seg id="5073">47	149	This is a perfect time for me to try once again to gain the supreme power that I want.</seg>
<seg id="5074">52	217	Well, we've both got companies to run, - so that's important, but I think... - Right.</seg>
<seg id="5075">30	404	Nanny had to leave, but said you can to pay it next time</seg>
<seg id="5076">15	867	Mr Wang, will you bring my luggage to the room?</seg>
<seg id="5077">36	463	I never did one thing right in my life. You know that?</seg>
<seg id="5078">43	201	A good guy who hasn't committed a sin.</seg>
<seg id="5079">23	139	No, seriously. I don't want to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="5080">1	1005	I do not believe Clint gave a number. We didn't know a number.</seg>
<seg id="5081">45	559	despite that, the architectural innovations of Nero's Domus Aurea lived on;</seg>
<seg id="5082">39	130	Danny, you have some chocolate sauce on your chin.</seg>
<seg id="5083">19	406	Make a Iot of money! Stingy ass!</seg>
<seg id="5084">18	574	Yes, I'm glad the cancer's gone, and, yes, I want to party like a rock star.</seg>
<seg id="5085">16	541	...and knowing that I wasn't alone.</seg>
<seg id="5086">11	136	It's the responsibility of the government, of having opened this Pandora box...</seg>
<seg id="5087">11	233	—I've seen your film. The Hotel Rwanda. —Oh, great.</seg>
<seg id="5088">31	496	...and they are inviting foreign officials, especially from the United Kingdom...</seg>
<seg id="5089">47	165	So it gives you some sense of the magnitude of this man's building objectives and is very important to us as a compendium of what he does.</seg>
<seg id="5090">31	112	Yeah, well, that's never gonna happen.</seg>
<seg id="5091">46	434	And what's depicted here--whether the magistrate is distributing free bread or it's bread being sold, we're not absolutely sure--but what you can see here is piles and piles of round breads that are being distributed to those who stand in front of the bread stand.</seg>
<seg id="5092">20	547	What did you...? No one's called me J. J. since college.</seg>
<seg id="5093">11	27	Back then I felt I had perfected the art of walking through without taking a single flyer.</seg>
<seg id="5094">8	84	It's really nice of you to come with me,</seg>
<seg id="5095">23	838	But, well, I'm having these feelings.</seg>
<seg id="5096">47	32	And although Caesar himself was dictator, not emperor he is the first of the Caesars who is covered by Suetonius.</seg>
<seg id="5097">5	523	The Holy Stone will never be taken!</seg>
<seg id="5098">55	555	substances called amyloid proteins build up in the body's organs, shutting them down.</seg>
<seg id="5099">20	376	Dude, please. You definitely don't have it.</seg>
<seg id="5100">13	700	They might have added a Magdalene to it.</seg>
<seg id="5101">42	411	What? No! I-I didn't tell him.</seg>
<seg id="5102">44	476	It's part of the mood of nationalism and of imperialism, of the New Imperialism.</seg>
<seg id="5103">15	602	Mrs Wang, smoking is not good for you</seg>
<seg id="5104">42	190	Uh, for the purposes of this hypothetical, let's call it...</seg>
<seg id="5105">33	503	.are having our views distorted by your newspapers and on TV.</seg>
<seg id="5106">30	239	Because I can to call an ambulance</seg>
<seg id="5107">17	504	Now that would have been the perfect starter car for Josh.</seg>
<seg id="5108">14	222	He said it was fine. - Who said it was fine?</seg>
<seg id="5109">50	215	The guys I know are young and childish.</seg>
<seg id="5110">51	239	Who are you fighting for in that uniform? Me?</seg>
<seg id="5111">42	261	Doesn't matter if they made a mistake or not.</seg>
<seg id="5112">28	459	Ronon, you need to trust us.</seg>
<seg id="5113">46	398	And we look at that detail here, and we see that these</seg>
<seg id="5114">36	469	I'm taking you to the train station, yes.</seg>
<seg id="5115">43	572	This is Yoo Chang-won. Let's meet.</seg>
<seg id="5116">13	403	Wow, she's good. - She's the best.</seg>
<seg id="5117">2	337	Our second location that we went to was at an at&t store in downtown manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="5118">43	498	I'll repent for the rest of my life.</seg>
<seg id="5119">14	251	Sweetie, please don't worry about it. Everyone knows you're the best.</seg>
<seg id="5120">28	247	Good. Now you and me can catch up.</seg>
<seg id="5121">8	336	Come on now, you two lovebirds, It's showtime, - If you would care to, - Gate open, boss,</seg>
<seg id="5122">23	572	What are you doing? -Jacket's caught.</seg>
<seg id="5123">13	99	Do you want me to get you a mirror? - I'm back. Let's go.</seg>
<seg id="5124">46	160	This figure is of particular interest.</seg>
<seg id="5125">37	172	But I had to stop before I died, because otherwise it wasn't fun.</seg>
<seg id="5126">39	54	Right there. And this is a six-CD changer.</seg>
<seg id="5127">19	297	Women who were interested in certain things' used to visit me.</seg>
<seg id="5128">2	967	But I have another problem, which is Liza</seg>
<seg id="5129">5	28	And we already called the soldiers!</seg>
<seg id="5130">2	804	And I could rely on liza to find us a location,</seg>
<seg id="5131">47	408	But we see here a sacrifice itself where the animal victims are being brought in for slaughter.</seg>
<seg id="5132">44	442	I didn't get a single badge, but a scout.</seg>
<seg id="5133">18	292	Besides the waitress's car, there's a sports car, a blue minivan, a rusty pickup, an old motorcycle, and two sedans:</seg>
<seg id="5134">23	980	So? -I don't answer when I'm eating.</seg>
<seg id="5135">27	632	If they find us here, we'll all be killed.</seg>
<seg id="5136">1	815	And you start talking about you.</seg>
<seg id="5137">46	340	I want to show you in the half an hour that remains a number of other paintings, in much less detail, but paintings that also are of special subjects, that also belong to Second, Third or Fourth Style walls, and are particularly interesting in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="5138">51	169	Well, if I was to ask you the same question...</seg>
<seg id="5139">45	38	a new dynasty that he called after his family name</seg>
<seg id="5140">6	489	You and I together One last time Osiphilious,</seg>
<seg id="5141">21	436	...And now we just wanna spend all of our time together.</seg>
<seg id="5142">13	571	Now, walk smooth. That's the new Harry Potter on your heads.</seg>
<seg id="5143">1	567	It sets up the mood. For sure.</seg>
<seg id="5144">25	393	Don't say he'd think less of me.</seg>
<seg id="5145">11	81	You can see that the potential...</seg>
<seg id="5146">16	68	Einstein believed it was why he perceived the universe differently</seg>
<seg id="5147">31	154	l'lI let the general take you through it, sir.</seg>
<seg id="5148">6	412	a hereo, where are these great amazons of myth who dare to fight and kill men,</seg>
<seg id="5149">23	672	Yeah. Well, now that I know that you're unavailable, it makes this easier.</seg>
<seg id="5150">14	614	that she completely deserves to take!</seg>
<seg id="5151">12	14	Yeah. - And knocked a pedestrian...</seg>
<seg id="5152">33	272	Yeah, that's right. How did you know?</seg>
<seg id="5153">42	577	With a "hypothetical." Truthfully, I expected him to be less of a wuss.</seg>
<seg id="5154">39	119	Here is your table. - Great.</seg>
<seg id="5155">15	566	Even a drunkard's a bit sober. Did you do it?</seg>
<seg id="5156">35	326	Yes. but who does it really benefit?</seg>
<seg id="5157">29	166	The front half of the ship cannot rematerialise,</seg>
<seg id="5158">13	273	Do you have a chart? I love charts. - Forget it, kill yourself.</seg>
<seg id="5159">39	309	There's-There's-There's something, uh, here. There are... things</seg>
<seg id="5160">14	214	This school is so different from Stars Hollow.</seg>
<seg id="5161">35	144	He said, "Well. that's when l don't feel like swimming at all."</seg>
<seg id="5162">47	382	We can see that the altar proper was located in the center of the structure.</seg>
<seg id="5163">33	105	I ain't got nothing to say to you, sir.</seg>
<seg id="5164">9	160	What happened to you? I thought you were going to call.</seg>
<seg id="5165">23	955	Yeah, and then you found Darren.</seg>
<seg id="5166">47	378	We know that it--there's a lot of controversy as to exactly what event is referred to on this monument, because we'll see that there is a procession that refers to some historical event.</seg>
<seg id="5167">20	299	I mean, the past three months have been so hard on them, on this whole family.</seg>
<seg id="5168">3	701	Chief, Mr. Chun is there. Let's report to him.</seg>
<seg id="5169">13	176	Not a lot of social activities, though.</seg>
<seg id="5170">20	509	No time. It's 11 : 30 right now. She's gonna be dead in half an hour!</seg>
<seg id="5171">23	248	It's fine. -Takes a little muscle.</seg>
<seg id="5172">2	946	I did! I told her what to buy.</seg>
<seg id="5173">5	64	Didn't you meet the Grim Reaper?</seg>
<seg id="5174">16	335	Swift, Josh. Remind them to punish you.</seg>
<seg id="5175">5	314	I understand him since we have experienced similar suffering.</seg>
<seg id="5176">35	149	Come on. Bal. Look around you.</seg>
<seg id="5177">46	229	The next scene that we see is also a very interesting scene and a very important one.</seg>
<seg id="5178">13	415	and if I'm to fetch you like a dog, I'd like a cookie and a raise.</seg>
<seg id="5179">25	679	All we need now is for you to tell us where to find our gold.</seg>
<seg id="5180">15	416	You'll be blessed with male heirs each year. Right, and so on</seg>
<seg id="5181">45	455	but you might remember that section that I showed you from the Temple of Venus Genetrix in the Forum of Julius Caesar, where I mentioned that that had been restored in the time of Domitian, second son of Vespasian, and also in the Trajanic period.</seg>
<seg id="5182">7	950	Nagurski wasn't supposed to play. Third-string fullback.</seg>
<seg id="5183">27	371	There's no way to test it, except in actual use.</seg>
<seg id="5184">15	899	Still not up at this hour?</seg>
<seg id="5185">7	628	I'll be on the road for a few days. Be back Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="5186">28	508	No, huh? Well, I'm glad we could both, uh, still laugh about this together.</seg>
<seg id="5187">31	214	TelI me about Taxi Rider. Jo Jo Foster.</seg>
<seg id="5188">23	452	But we are taking this into overtime!</seg>
<seg id="5189">2	722	The con was that the premise was naturally flawed, again.</seg>
<seg id="5190">42	450	Dr. Stone, did you promise Karen Masters she would receive a heart?</seg>
<seg id="5191">33	389	Fifty minutes of his alibi hinges on his wife.</seg>
<seg id="5192">31	493	...my instincts told me it was not nuclear.</seg>
<seg id="5193">25	575	But if it's a choice of them or this island, well, I guess we've got to stay here a little while longer.</seg>
<seg id="5194">46	13	With regard to Fourth Style, the introduction of architecture, once again, on either side of the main panel in the main zone.</seg>
<seg id="5195">15	614	I'd rather forfeit years of my life</seg>
<seg id="5196">50	219	It's better if they're not responsible rather than hearing them say they care.</seg>
<seg id="5197">2	720	Both in the commercial, as well as during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="5198">43	300	Prove it if you can! You son of a bitch!</seg>
<seg id="5199">2	665	Great. Unbelievable. It was so good.</seg>
<seg id="5200">19	528	They also forced these girls to have abortions.</seg>
<seg id="5201">32	403	It's really hard when you can't see 'em anymore.</seg>
<seg id="5202">50	63	Are you at Daemyung University? What's it like?</seg>
<seg id="5203">47	500	There is a nod to ancient Rome with the travertine wall that is outside and continues inside.</seg>
<seg id="5204">7	602	Maybe I'll get a raise after this.</seg>
<seg id="5205">32	775	It's a--lt's a mystery. I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="5206">45	296	And I use it here to show you two things.</seg>
<seg id="5207">24	600	Some water then, to slake your current thirst.</seg>
<seg id="5208">16	393	"Eliminate the threat?" What does that mean?</seg>
<seg id="5209">2	24	I'm going out on a limb and saying I like this better. Okay, well, good.</seg>
<seg id="5210">53	365	I was in osaka It was just too far</seg>
<seg id="5211">8	522	Congratulations,  Don't worry, Mino, I'm gonna take care of you,</seg>
<seg id="5212">13	207	None of this, however, will be of any benefit to you.</seg>
<seg id="5213">27	244	Do you know the plan of this building?</seg>
<seg id="5214">47	281	We see a wall in Carrara marble and we see the distinction between that and the peperino walls.</seg>
<seg id="5215">9	469	Okay look, you should get ready. The bank will be open for three hours today and traffic will be hell.</seg>
<seg id="5216">18	147	You are getting that this is a cancer metaphor, right?</seg>
<seg id="5217">45	458	We see also the interesting--the variety of motifs in this frieze, and in the decorative part of it.</seg>
<seg id="5218">1	344	We've got to figure that out and make that determination.</seg>
<seg id="5219">6	504	Alexander bid the east farewell and marched his army directly west,</seg>
<seg id="5220">16	293	I feel like I've lost one of my own children</seg>
<seg id="5221">32	193	Good. Excuse us one second, Dennis.</seg>
<seg id="5222">51	90	And a wife has the right to talk about her husband any time she wants.</seg>
<seg id="5223">28	142	Well, anyone you could spare would be great.</seg>
<seg id="5224">39	483	That came out of a total moment where l- - It's okay. It's okay.</seg>
<seg id="5225">45	351	So another smart, strategic move on the part</seg>
<seg id="5226">18	317	I mean, I could cut you in for, say, 10%?</seg>
<seg id="5227">11	398	How can we move forward from here so that these people don't die?</seg>
<seg id="5228">25	447	Oh, there's no gold on this island.</seg>
<seg id="5229">22	227	Captain, this being a stealth op and all...</seg>
<seg id="5230">4	159	Somebody back east is saying, "Why don't she write?"</seg>
<seg id="5231">15	424	Granny, after combing, you look years younger</seg>
<seg id="5232">51	479	The pretty cop is safe. My word.</seg>
<seg id="5233">13	111	See, that's what happens when you go to bed with your makeup on.</seg>
<seg id="5234">30	545	Do you know someone on the list of planting</seg>
<seg id="5235">14	288	I'm sorry. Is that stupid? - No, it's not stupid.</seg>
<seg id="5236">2	203	Call the photographer. Call the casting.</seg>
<seg id="5237">47	189	I show you a view here of the marble quarries, or one of the marble quarries, at Luna/Carrara, what it looks like today.</seg>
<seg id="5238">1	170	They're trying to make money off of this show.</seg>
<seg id="5239">45	73	And what I show you first here is a restored view that comes from the Ward-Perkins textbook, where you can get a very good sense of what this platform looked like.</seg>
<seg id="5240">3	238	Please come to visit me again soon.</seg>
<seg id="5241">1	685	I'd like to show that to the women.</seg>
<seg id="5242">5	326	I promised that I wouldn't change, but I feel like I'm getting worse.</seg>
<seg id="5243">42	253	I've been practicing for ten years, and I haven't been sued once.</seg>
<seg id="5244">29	490	Then we must do something now!</seg>
<seg id="5245">1	874	You really are abrasive. Mr. Trump, that's my personality.</seg>
<seg id="5246">35	479	Lonely Mr. Kholi from Los Angeles</seg>
<seg id="5247">17	521	That's true, but Kyle just read the manual.</seg>
<seg id="5248">2	830	Which is "her way or the highway,</seg>
<seg id="5249">1	836	I told her -- use her thumb.</seg>
<seg id="5250">51	472	No, no, no, no, no. No, that's not how it works.</seg>
<seg id="5251">44	281	This is, again, part of this old American western idea, but you apply it to indigenous people.</seg>
<seg id="5252">27	554	Daras, Secretary to the National Socialist Party.</seg>
<seg id="5253">14	569	Rory is never late. She's almost annoyingly on time.</seg>
<seg id="5254">42	413	You knew about her and Dowd? - No.</seg>
<seg id="5255">24	5	Something out of a fever dream.</seg>
<seg id="5256">25	601	My people eat the flesh of their enemies why your people drink the blood of their god.</seg>
<seg id="5257">5	153	I will go get her now.</seg>
<seg id="5258">8	187	It will take you right to M's quarters,  I'm sure glad I ain't you,</seg>
<seg id="5259">2	183	I have had experience in the past with commercial ads.</seg>

<seg id="5273">1	636	I would have liked to have seen was a little bit more involvement from stephanie, given her background.</seg>
<seg id="5274">11	423	...And has a great amount of economic influence.</seg>
<seg id="5275">41	267	You think gro plus is gonna say the ramirezes are to blame for blanca's sterility?</seg>
<seg id="5276">1	830	It was very interesting the way you did it.</seg>
<seg id="5277">53	489	Listen, listen, man you couldn't even do it on that kamehameha thing yes I could</seg>
<seg id="5278">39	149	Whew! I guess I'm gonna have to get out of this now. Um</seg>
<seg id="5279">1	299	One of the criterias is promotional items.</seg>
<seg id="5280">15	215	Cooking for 2 is one way to kill boredom</seg>
<seg id="5281">15	929	Are you going to the Marriage Registry?</seg>

<seg id="5287">14	751	Don't lose heart. Make this work.</seg>
<seg id="5288">2	747	There was no consistent brand messaging.</seg>
<seg id="5289">53	361	It's your fault It won't come out...</seg>
<seg id="5290">6	171	But I fear this world is far larger than anyone dreamed,</seg>
<seg id="5291">47	113	And we know that there were also scenes of cupids carrying the arms and armor, probably of Mars.</seg>
<seg id="5292">34	392	Well, I'd be even happier if we could have some hot water so I can take a shower.</seg>
<seg id="5293">32	18	Hey, it doesn't matter. Anywhere you want.</seg>
<seg id="5294">22	657	This mission was off. Primary target was a setup.</seg>
<seg id="5295">8	254	Yet it was not long before the diseases and bewitchments which I'd encountered during my voyage began to disfigure my body,</seg>
<seg id="5296">11	237	We just gotta get people there.</seg>
<seg id="5297">25	759	There are only two of you, and you can't even reach your powder.</seg>
<seg id="5298">20	622	Aunt Elizabeth, come on! - Come on!</seg>
<seg id="5299">46	10	We see those here; we see them over here as well--those, again, elements of the Second Style.</seg>
<seg id="5300">14	42	We're gonna stage an intervention with the neon Post-its...</seg>
<seg id="5301">3	356	We're policemen under attack. Call the police.</seg>
<seg id="5302">2	1023	She came up with the wrong concept,</seg>

<seg id="5304">11	17	—Come here, Lucky. Let's see if we match. —Here, Dad, hand him to me.</seg>

<seg id="5315">35	588	you know. actually. l prefer American hip-hop.</seg>
<seg id="5316">27	445	This goes against every principle John Gill ever believed in.</seg>
<seg id="5317">46	401	We see that the artist has shown a striking penchant for, or a sensitivity for composition, for light, the way in which light falls on objects that are made of different materials, be it metal or stone.</seg>
<seg id="5318">14	473	Okay, wait. Think. Listen. Here. You drive.</seg>
<seg id="5319">29	105	I think they picked up and left.</seg>
<seg id="5320">35	234	A good room. about $400-$500 a night.</seg>
<seg id="5321">37	376	And girls who won't make my tea do not ever get to see my cock again, and that is what you call social deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="5322">19	62	Soon- yi? I think our meeting is fate.</seg>
<seg id="5323">44	395	His advice to his own garrison is to "sit tight and shoot straight.</seg>

<seg id="5335">13	626	We would've been done, but the frog search put us way behind.</seg>
<seg id="5336">45	360	And there were consequently always fires there.</seg>
<seg id="5337">11	458	We must diminish the number of convoys that we're sending.</seg>

<seg id="5348">32	92	I was just trying-- - You know, I'm just tired.</seg>
<seg id="5349">33	81	Maybe they had a beer. - Not these boys.</seg>
<seg id="5350">6	110	I have given you ample proof,</seg>

<seg id="5370">45	430	You see here another Google--an excellent Google Earth view, aerial view, of part of the Roman Forum.</seg>
<seg id="5371">14	57	finally comes back to haunt us on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5372">37	717	I'm not supposed to help you with your exam.</seg>
<seg id="5373">11	232	—Mr. Cheadle, how are you? —Good to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="5374">17	214	After I leave, do you just stay here?</seg>
<seg id="5375">39	214	Why don't you see Dr. Evans one more time.</seg>
<seg id="5376">18	426	Thank you for thinking of it.</seg>
<seg id="5377">46	498	But she's more than happy to be represented, as she was, preserved for posterity, as she was, along with her husband over here.</seg>
<seg id="5378">51	182	Jason was helping him, you know.</seg>
<seg id="5379">23	52	...Three sizes of bevy are small, medium and what?</seg>
<seg id="5380">24	345	A theme with you, is it not?</seg>
<seg id="5381">13	740	What do you mean? - I mean, do you think he's cute?</seg>
<seg id="5382">54	174	Must be allergicto something we used in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="5383">11	78	Well, I wouldn't want horsemen riding down on me and killing my children.</seg>
<seg id="5384">21	702	It's been like that since the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="5385">47	10	I want to give you a little bit of information about Caesar, about his life, about some of his accomplishments because these are going to have an impact on the architecture, on our discussion of the architecture that he commissioned in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="5386">32	584	I'm gonna show my face for twenty minutes...</seg>
<seg id="5387">7	824	...and if you see them or find evidence on them...</seg>
<seg id="5388">33	280	I want the area searched. Every inch. - Yes, sir.</seg>
<seg id="5389">46	389	So it's a Romanization of an original Greek painting, in an extraordinary way that tells us a good deal about how the Romans were thinking about these Greek prototypes at this particular juncture.</seg>
<seg id="5390">29	366	I truly do. But there's nothing I can do about that right now. I have to go.</seg>
<seg id="5391">45	112	But clearly, whatever it meant, if it was just to point to his antiquarian interest, his interest in more old-fashioned stone construction at this particular point, it does seem to have something to do with the particular personality of this particular patron.</seg>
<seg id="5392">31	68	Viet cong did their thing on me for three days.</seg>
<seg id="5393">24	340	One day, maybe you prove yourself.</seg>

<seg id="5395">43	434	We heard your wife has been hospitalized for a long time now...</seg>
<seg id="5396">35	384	India sets you free my eyes are searching. my hips are working my lips are waiting. take me to love</seg>

<seg id="5398">2	597	Honey, it's live TV from at&t mobile.</seg>
<seg id="5399">41	408	The doctor-- he did some tests, and--and h-he said that it was my fault.</seg>
<seg id="5400">27	485	Where's the entrance to the broadcast booth?</seg>
<seg id="5401">39	164	who didn't first have to come to terms with the fact that I'm blind.</seg>
<seg id="5402">6	463	Why, so you could have us killed, son of zeus.</seg>
<seg id="5403">39	475	Hey! Stop talking like that! - Morning, ugly.</seg>
<seg id="5404">21	226	Let time repent And unsow its seeds</seg>
<seg id="5405">39	118	[Man] I didn't know i had to stop.</seg>
<seg id="5406">45	229	So these columns have no structural purpose whatsoever, and they are here essentially as the icing on the cake, as ornamentation or decoration, but ornamentation or decoration that has certain meaning to it:</seg>
<seg id="5407">47	465	M-U-S-S-O-L; part of it scratched out after his death and discredit in the '30s.</seg>
<seg id="5408">22	287	So the Army ought to be the one to clean it up.</seg>
<seg id="5409">45	469	And also the decorative nature of this conjures up some of the decoration that we see, the profusion, the almost overly decorative element of Fourth Style Roman wall painting.</seg>
<seg id="5410">6	211	Oh no, hold on, hold on, breathe, breathe.</seg>
<seg id="5411">29	290	So it incapacitates first with pain and prophases.</seg>
<seg id="5412">1	98	Anyways, it doesn't matter. So what?</seg>
<seg id="5413">36	76	Please, listen, I got a wife.</seg>
<seg id="5414">28	20	Kaufman, this is Lorne... any activity?</seg>

<seg id="5416">16	162	He brings any useful ideas I have to the outside world, and it's Foss' job to protect me from it - From Zzyzx? - Yes</seg>
<seg id="5417">37	635	You took lots of other pills too.</seg>
<seg id="5418">43	80	It's clear two big fish and a loach made fun of us.</seg>
<seg id="5419">23	852	A Big Montana from Arby's with curly fries.</seg>
<seg id="5420">2	410	And present it to the executives tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="5421">5	247	If I can only get a hold of Chun-hon's Holy Stone, there will be no more victims.</seg>
<seg id="5422">11	6	I think you need to ask yourself, "What's the threshold?</seg>
<seg id="5423">25	892	Unless you wish to join your countrymen.</seg>
<seg id="5424">43	304	Ah, by the way, your wife looked nice.</seg>
<seg id="5425">46	103	The story continues from the boy reading the liturgy to the figure that you see here.</seg>
<seg id="5426">39	345	What i've got to do, you can't be any part of.</seg>
<seg id="5427">54	477	Tritter releasedour bank accounts. - Horrible, horrible news.</seg>
<seg id="5428">13	173	Dinner, Friday night. No spurs, please.</seg>

<seg id="5433">55	453	He's got a partial hprt enzyme deficiency.</seg>
<seg id="5434">33	93	Is the wait worth it? - We're not full for nothing, sugar.</seg>
<seg id="5435">14	598	Do you have any idea what we have gone through this week?</seg>
<seg id="5436">14	697	I'm worried about that. I have to be.</seg>
<seg id="5437">27	795	I think, was the Leader Principle.</seg>
<seg id="5438">14	36	All right, fine. Here's your serious paper. - Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="5439">51	397	So as long as you keep your payments up...</seg>
<seg id="5440">33	197	Who's the big shot? - It's the Klan.</seg>
<seg id="5441">45	340	it was that kind of thing that was being looked back to.</seg>
<seg id="5442">13	669	That's how I am! - Florence, I'm dripping.</seg>
<seg id="5443">9	558	I'm only trying to help. All right?</seg>
<seg id="5444">46	483	It may also be that this was just a set way of representing women in portraiture in Pompeii.</seg>
<seg id="5445">11	238	And what I think is, when they see particularly a humanitarian situation...</seg>
<seg id="5446">9	651	Look at it. It's all for us.</seg>
<seg id="5447">39	81	[Laughs] - You never told me that.</seg>
<seg id="5448">51	145	So do you want to talk about it?</seg>
<seg id="5449">23	458	Okay, now, Sandy? That girl, she's a nice girl.</seg>
<seg id="5450">46	108	there's a lot of purple in this scen a very vividly purple skirt, as you can see down here.</seg>
<seg id="5451">50	553	How can you pilot a plane if you're that weak?</seg>
<seg id="5452">46	171	So again, the artist has taken the corner into consideration and created this dramatic interaction between this woman and whatever it is that she's afraid of on the other side of the corner.</seg>
<seg id="5453">47	427	Here's that inner precinct that we've just described.</seg>
<seg id="5454">2	708	That could be a killer idea. You understand that.</seg>
<seg id="5455">45	361	And you'll remember that Augustus' architects had to build that large precinct wall out of peperino to protect the Temple of Mars Ultor from the fires that used to break out all the time in the Subura.</seg>
<seg id="5456">35	165	From Amritsar to UK there are stars in your way</seg>

<seg id="5459">44	401	Of course, school children, there's an enormous, enormous outpouring of tears over the death of this man.</seg>
<seg id="5460">28	240	Yeah, yeah, OK, I didn't see that one coming!</seg>
<seg id="5461">18	720	Kyle said he's taking care of it.</seg>
<seg id="5462">27	640	[McCoy]He's reaching a level of consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="5463">39	163	No. I just thought that maybe i could go out with someone...</seg>
<seg id="5464">23	1083	Okay. I deserved that. But now let me explain...</seg>
<seg id="5465">17	531	Like a mathematical equation, it was just a matter of recognizing patterns and familiar shapes.</seg>
<seg id="5466">31	96	You see, America sees two Koreas:</seg>
<seg id="5467">47	390	The fact that there were double doorways -- very significant, and we've tried to sort out why that might be.</seg>
<seg id="5468">39	90	It's gonna be about an hour.</seg>
<seg id="5469">31	150	...are far greater than the Pentagon estimates.</seg>
<seg id="5470">44	45	Some of the opposition in the liberal party were opposed, ran on a campaign of anti-imperialism.</seg>
<seg id="5471">46	18	We looked at it from the standpoint of its architectural evolution.</seg>
<seg id="5472">53	322	Soon, I came across Bubu the pig, planting turnip seeds in a field</seg>
<seg id="5473">19	96	The VMax has a V- Boost induction.</seg>

<seg id="5476">19	129	Yes. is Your family well? - Yes, they're all good.</seg>
<seg id="5477">8	531	Wait, I--I think I know what it is,</seg>
<seg id="5478">14	242	Okay. Before you get all goofy on me, I don't have your porcinis.</seg>
<seg id="5479">27	53	And what's going on down there on Ekos?</seg>
<seg id="5480">30	474	I have been in the house</seg>
<seg id="5481">25	146	See, there's an awful lot of this island even I haven't seen.</seg>
<seg id="5482">13	483	It's possible? - There's a resemblance.</seg>
<seg id="5483">17	224	You know, if you ever need anything...</seg>
<seg id="5484">3	623	Parts of you will be in a bottle overseas.</seg>
<seg id="5485">15	434	I bet Granny is OK. She's normally healthy. Don't cry</seg>
<seg id="5486">25	177	You are never far away from me.</seg>
<seg id="5487">8	225	If I succeed, we'll meet back here,</seg>
<seg id="5488">45	81	So when Agrippina made a decision to put up a building honoring her husband, after his death, a temple that would be to him as a divus, she turns back to the style that he himself seems to have favored, this combination of rusticated and finished masonry, to use for that building.</seg>
<seg id="5489">23	509	Because you're guarding Judith. I'm dealing with Darren and Sandy.</seg>
<seg id="5490">42	684	You were always his favorite, Eli.</seg>
<seg id="5491">18	278	You can find yourself another DJ.</seg>
<seg id="5492">11	536	—How you doing? —I'm good. How are you?</seg>
<seg id="5493">44	126	In the very well-documented case of what happened in what now is Congo and Zaire, which were sort of the private colony of the king of Belgium, the atrocities there are well-known.</seg>
<seg id="5494">22	53	The fuel rods have been removed from the fourth reactor...</seg>
<seg id="5495">14	604	Why don't we narrow our field of conversation down to Rory?</seg>
<seg id="5496">25	455	Your men will have to build a raft.</seg>
<seg id="5497">5	51	Not again! Don't be so nice!</seg>
<seg id="5498">20	630	So I'll see you guys Saturday. - OK. The girls'll bake for you.</seg>
<seg id="5499">12	178	...and Leigh here can cook us...a nice romantic dinner for three. - Did we just miss our stop?</seg>
<seg id="5500">15	915	Maybe he's miserly. The sizes may change, too</seg>
<seg id="5501">21	134	He wants to have dinner. This isn't what I wanted.</seg>
<seg id="5502">15	947	Don't rub it with your hand. Look, open wide your eyes</seg>
<seg id="5503">19	19	Honestly, in your case, you need more than a Iove charm.</seg>
<seg id="5504">3	519	I don't even know if I'll get anything.</seg>
<seg id="5505">7	895	Sorry I'm late. I forgot the time.</seg>
<seg id="5506">15	685	Uncle. You fool around when Li's away</seg>
<seg id="5507">2	746	You talked about flo tv. You talked about at&t mobile tv.</seg>
<seg id="5508">11	242	Because I think they will then take it upon themselves.</seg>
<seg id="5509">45	510	A men's section and a women's section, with that sequence of rooms: the apodyterium or the dressing room;</seg>
<seg id="5510">47	89	It has a facade orientation, although one idiosyncrasy of this particular temple is that the staircase is located, not just on the front, but on the two sides, but only at the level of the podium.</seg>
<seg id="5511">30	213	What was said about his wife?</seg>
<seg id="5512">25	279	See what you get when you try to be friendly?</seg>
<seg id="5513">1	690	I don't see how it relates to the play itself.</seg>
<seg id="5514">20	166	And I'm in the way. -No, you're not.</seg>
<seg id="5515">47	490	Meier built a Jubilee Church a few years--a number of years ago, and Renzo Piano, and other architects have been working in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="5516">45	108	One could go very far and say that's Claudius waiting inside to emerge sometime;</seg>
<seg id="5517">22	169	...The lead scientist on the decommissioning team.</seg>
<seg id="5518">17	294	But gas is really expensive these days.</seg>
<seg id="5519">14	388	That's worse. That's not you. You didn't feel sorry for yourself...when it took you three months to learn how to ride a bike.</seg>
<seg id="5520">1	262	Just my first original impression of Na-a-a-n</seg>
<seg id="5521">44	195	When he went back to England he thought that British youth were cigarette-smoking, heavy-drinking, flabby weaklings, whether they were upper classes and, even worse, his few lower classes, because they were underfed and therefore smaller.</seg>
<seg id="5522">45	415	So it was in part a place where he could display the spoils of war, because of the fact that the legitimacy that he gained through this conquest was so important to his dynasty, to the right of his dynasty to rule, and to the right of his sons to rule after him.</seg>
<seg id="5523">8	518	Good accounts make for good friends, isn't that right?</seg>
<seg id="5524">11	63	But as an actor and the son of a psychologist and the son of an educator...</seg>
<seg id="5525">36	300	Charlene Baltimore died in my employ. Relic of the Cold War.</seg>

<seg id="5529">33	107	Before the locals got a chance to say yes, the Klan burned 'em down.</seg>
<seg id="5530">16	447	And by the way you're not concerned about kyle.</seg>
<seg id="5531">45	32	You see him on the gold coin on the right.</seg>
<seg id="5532">47	364	I've written a lot on this monument and have a lot of thoughts, which have changed significantly over the years, about this very important structure.</seg>
<seg id="5533">54	22	okay, I appreciatethe fullness of your answers, but I just wanted to know if she had any history of abdominal problems.</seg>
<seg id="5534">13	623	I don't understand. - We can't find the frog.</seg>
<seg id="5535">9	207	Yes. With an assumed masters degree.</seg>
<seg id="5536">17	498	I wish there was some way I could make it up to him.</seg>
<seg id="5537">8	266	Ah, well, if you can't control yourself, you shouldn't indulge,</seg>
<seg id="5538">1	47	Lisa, who would you fire, Kelly or Stephanie?</seg>
<seg id="5539">6	156	In his dream it was the promised to the end of the wall,</seg>

<seg id="5544">37	4	She said she had been to a bad party the night before.</seg>
<seg id="5545">2	498	There's no energy. What's up with that? - score!</seg>
<seg id="5546">11	243	I'm gonna do what I can, and actually what I can do is something substantial.</seg>
<seg id="5547">45	132	The greatest, the most famous building that was put up by Vespasian, in the Flavian period, was the so-called Colosseum, which he began in the year 70 A. D. so contemporaneous to the construction of the Claudianum.</seg>

<seg id="5555">24	315	There is no love lost between myself and Crixus...</seg>
<seg id="5556">31	506	Perhaps the most troubling theory put forth to explain the large cloud...</seg>
<seg id="5557">43	736	It doesn't mean shit to me to kill a piece of shit like you.</seg>
<seg id="5558">9	362	Viking stuff made in Norway, which is excellent.</seg>

<seg id="5571">24	408	The senate has become his mistress.</seg>
<seg id="5572">44	170	The title escapes me at the moment, but these are just fantastic, just gripping, just chilling accounts of essentially the mass murder, incarceration, and murder, and shooting, under the guise of "trying to escape" and all of this of hundreds of thousands of people.</seg>
<seg id="5573">1	839	Mr. Trump, can I respond? How long could you take the finger in your face</seg>

<seg id="5578">24	253	Taken from me when I was captured by the romans.</seg>
<seg id="5579">3	418	Good. Take him back for me.</seg>
<seg id="5580">47	26	He was acclaimed Dictator in that year in 45, and after that he pursued fiscal reforms for Rome, and also he commissioned a number of very important public works, and that's where Roman architecture obviously comes into play.</seg>

<seg id="5648">40	127	My friend viv-- he cured her tennis elbow and constipation in one visit.</seg>
<seg id="5649">47	131	You see now portraits of Mark Antony on the right-hand of the screen, a black basalt portrait of Antony, now in England, and a portrait of Rome's first emperor, Octavian Augustus, on the left-hand of the screen, a fantastic bronze image of him that was part of an equestrian statue found in the North Sea near Greece.</seg>
<seg id="5650">47	137	Octavian joined, with Antony, with Mark Antony, and a man by the name of Lepidus, to form what we know of as the Second Triumvirate and that happened in the year 43 B. C.</seg>

<seg id="5663">47	311	You can see that the exterior of the structure was quite plain, just in the way that a Domus Italica outside was plain, and it was only when you got inside that you got a real sense of the glory of the architecture.</seg>
<seg id="5664">45	141	And, in fact, there was a scheme a number of years ago now-- probably several decades ago by now</seg>
<seg id="5665">3	508	But this decaying colonial system does not permit the existence of a true, good policeman.</seg>

<seg id="5672">3	499	That's what I like about being a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="5673">15	789	I swam over and shot it with a harpoon</seg>
<seg id="5674">2	632	That's true. They did have great energy. Uh-huh.</seg>
<seg id="5675">27	258	Are - Are you trying to kill yourselves?</seg>
<seg id="5676">44	140	Borders are something that were artificially constructed by these powers to say, "Here.</seg>

<seg id="5682">1	834	Oh, the point of the finger.</seg>
<seg id="5683">46	270	And then there's another thyrsus of Dionysus that seems to be located-- that is located between these two women, and one wonders again how in the world that thyrsus is being held up, as this woman is participating in this dance and music-making over here at the right.</seg>
<seg id="5684">27	271	I would be honored, Mr. Spock.</seg>
<seg id="5685">27	267	What is it you're making, some kind of radio?</seg>
<seg id="5686">21	744	...And had to wear a girdle on your last movie.</seg>
<seg id="5687">35	143	The father nodded and said, "Why is the third pool empty?"</seg>

<seg id="5689">27	81	You've defiled us for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="5690">46	110	And she and all of them, by the way, wear bracelets.</seg>

<seg id="5698">1	322	Exactly. Making sure that it's getting done. Right.</seg>
<seg id="5699">50	327	But how could he if he had a sick mother around all the time?</seg>
<seg id="5700">41	542	Sometimes the--the closer you are to someone, the harder it is to tell 'em your secrets.</seg>
<seg id="5701">39	195	Let him go! Put him down! - Jay, come on!</seg>
<seg id="5702">47	62	So you can see it was adjacent to, and in fact connected to, the Roman forum that lay over here.</seg>

<seg id="5707">15	480	We are not meant for each other</seg>
<seg id="5708">42	216	All right, point is, Elliott, it's no harm, no foul.</seg>
<seg id="5709">1	1052	Then I would have stayed in the game longer</seg>
<seg id="5710">31	17	...we had hopes for a preemptive, speciaI operations mission.</seg>
<seg id="5711">39	154	just sit back and enjoy the show, Mr. Blue Eyes.</seg>

<seg id="5715">35	263	I think you should find someone simple and traditional to teach you to dance like the natives.</seg>
<seg id="5716">3	321	I brought handcuffs, but not the keys.</seg>
<seg id="5717">1	359	All of a sudden, Steuart's gonna come out.</seg>
<seg id="5718">47	86	We can see it in plan, and it dominates the space in front of it just as the Capitolium did at Pompeii.</seg>
<seg id="5719">1	211	I don't care if Poppy listens to Miley Cyrus on her walkman while she works out.</seg>
<seg id="5720">28	18	Doesn't look like the sun killed him.</seg>
<seg id="5721">35	59	...for their daughters. Can we leave yet?</seg>
<seg id="5722">16	289	And this terrible sense that something is wrong</seg>
<seg id="5723">47	310	We see here a model of the Forum of Augustus, with the Temple of Mars Ultor inside that forum, with the embracing exedrae or hemicycles on either side.</seg>
<seg id="5724">2	340	And then you're gonna give me some knuckles.</seg>

<seg id="5731">6	547	And we will grow old Ephistian,</seg>

<seg id="5734">2	607	Flo TV on at&t mobile -- when live matters.</seg>
<seg id="5735">32	36	And that, you know, I was working the Mars as a metaphor angle.</seg>

<seg id="5753">46	481	It is probably a Pompeian woman, and she may not be thinking about the poetry that she's about to write, but perhaps the shopping list that she's putting together before she makes her way down to the central market of the city of Pompeii, or sends her slave to go down to the central market of the city of Pompeii.</seg>
<seg id="5754">2	354	Can you tell them to move away from the door?</seg>

<seg id="5771">6	157	We were now a mobile empire stretching back thousands of miles to Greece,</seg>
<seg id="5772">47	481	But I think when they decided to add the Ara Pacis to this complex, there was a great deal of thought that was given to siting it in relationship to the tomb, and to thinking about the whole as a complex, at least at that particular juncture.</seg>

<seg id="5818">1	355	Monologuing is the greatest intro because it is innocent,it is the character,</seg>
<seg id="5819">12	262	...the point is that it's happened before. It can't be a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="5820">54	389	I'm not gonna testifyjust because I have toborrow lunch money.</seg>
<seg id="5821">11	509	Are you sure it's this way?</seg>

<seg id="5854">25	449	If there ever was any, it's long gone.</seg>

<seg id="5856">47	429	And then on the other sides, the north and south, a frieze.</seg>
<seg id="5857">17	543	So you guys are-- - Over?</seg>

<seg id="5874">11	283	And this piece has no union bug.</seg>
<seg id="5875">1	826	I see it myself. It's incredible.</seg>
<seg id="5876">46	241	I can't imagine that it's correct, but nonetheless it gives you some sense of the kind of scholarship and some of the speculation there has been about what is actually going on here.</seg>
<seg id="5877">16	520	Why do you wanna go back there and complicate your life?</seg>
<seg id="5878">22	623	...But this time they handed it to us.</seg>
<seg id="5879">8	233	I'd recognize that sound anywhere, - Hmm,</seg>

<seg id="5886">3	496	I also understand that to overturn the Ching Government.</seg>
<seg id="5887">39	518	There's a blind guy driving this train! Everybody out of the way!</seg>
<seg id="5888">37	822	I'm sorry about what happened, Cassie!</seg>

<seg id="5898">14	553	There's a man with a funny accent on the phone, asking for you.</seg>
<seg id="5899">24	146	Twenty-eight and I'll resist pitching you off the balcony.</seg>
<seg id="5900">37	881	She's all I got, so I'm on her side.</seg>
<seg id="5901">23	423	We're out of lemons, but I'll run to the store...</seg>

<seg id="5911">51	104	Thank you very much. Aren't you supposed to be a silent partner?</seg>
<seg id="5912">42	38	Objects in the mirror are handsomer than they appear.</seg>
<seg id="5913">11	18	—How do we look? —Good. He looks better than you.</seg>

<seg id="5930">25	346	who goes next? - I do.</seg>
<seg id="5931">2	176	I'll be able to do a good job of getting everyone organized</seg>
<seg id="5932">16	305	Someone else cares about you besides me</seg>
<seg id="5933">2	918	I mean, Stephanie was clearly in charge of the task.</seg>
<seg id="5934">14	82	Bad grade? - I have to go.</seg>
<seg id="5935">46	180	We see another set of two young satyrs here, and an old Silenus again, and one of the satyrs holding up this horrible mask, and that seems to be what has put fear into the eyes of this particular woman.</seg>
<seg id="5936">40	135	Don't speak. It'd be an exparte conversation.</seg>

<seg id="5950">37	691	You may turn over your papers.</seg>
<seg id="5951">14	572	Okay. But see, she was up all night studying.</seg>

<seg id="5954">45	314	And so I wanted to show you another amphitheater where they are well preserved, so you can get a better sense of what those substructures would have looked like in antiquity.</seg>
<seg id="5955">14	687	You should get some sleep and eat a real meal...and come up for air once in a while.</seg>
<seg id="5956">1	642	Mahsa, what do you think of Liza?</seg>
<seg id="5957">18	433	Jessi, I'm so not in the mood.</seg>
<seg id="5958">47	126	And I mentioned to you at the time we talked about the Temple of Jupiter OMC, although the Campidoglio, as redesigned by Michelangelo, with the Senatorial Palace in the back, which is where the Temple of Jupiter OMC was, faces modern Rome.</seg>
<seg id="5959">8	275	Excuse me, sir, - Who dares disturb me?</seg>
<seg id="5960">33	343	You should start with the sheriff's office.</seg>
<seg id="5961">17	111	It's incredible who they let behind the wheel these days.</seg>
<seg id="5962">32	702	Maybe he is a little Mozart.</seg>
<seg id="5963">47	181	There was some flirtation with it.</seg>
<seg id="5964">18	281	Which means no one saw her drive away, so we can't even track her car.</seg>

<seg id="5968">23	23	And Darren joined the cheerleading squad.</seg>
<seg id="5969">43	46	I have a big deal coming up. What do you think?</seg>
<seg id="5970">27	226	So the Party has built us into a threat, a disease to be wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="5971">22	290	I don't give a damn about dispatch, lieutenant.</seg>
<seg id="5972">30	370	In fact, the cells in the heart of the grantor</seg>

<seg id="5989">44	12	If you were going to point out or to claim that there was a central reason for the New Imperialism, why even Bismarck, who described colonies as an albatross around the neck of Germany while he gets into the kind of feeding frenzy himself, it's been put rather cleverly by a guy called Baumgar a long time ago, that it comes down to God, gold, and glory.</seg>

<seg id="5991">8	394	It's a car; it's a Ferrari 250 GTO, 12 cylinder, - It's a birthday present, - You know how to drive that thing?</seg>
<seg id="5992">44	13	There were those who interpreted the mad quest for colonies as being the missionary impulse.</seg>
<seg id="5993">27	225	Because without us to hate, there'd be nothing to hold them together.</seg>
<seg id="5994">16	439	You let me worry about Foss.</seg>
<seg id="5995">21	370	So it says here that marriage can lead to a loss of passion.</seg>

<seg id="6001">33	98	There are some empty seats down there. - uh, Mr Ward...</seg>
<seg id="6002">15	275	I have my share of it</seg>
<seg id="6003">46	382	So since those words are misspelled, it has been speculated--and I think again quite convincingly</seg>

<seg id="6030">47	147	But at any rate, Mark Antony takes up with Cleopatra and he joins her in Egypt and he spends a good deal of his time in the eastern part of the Empire with his paramour.</seg>
<seg id="6031">29	232	So they might accidentally open the rear hatch or shut life support off entirely.</seg>
<seg id="6032">6	266	Or is his blood no longer good enough, Zeus</seg>

<seg id="6044">2	468	Hey, I got an idea, Steuart.</seg>
<seg id="6045">20	321	You need to get her to the hospital. - Right to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="6046">3	344	Avenge the death of three Cannons! Yes!</seg>
<seg id="6047">45	104	and I'll show you a better image in a moment where you can see this even more clearly</seg>
<seg id="6048">47	354	As you can see, the figures stand on bases, and figures that stand on bases in Roman relief sculpture are usually meant to be statues, and we believe that this is again a rendition of what that triple set of statues would have looked like inside the temple.</seg>
<seg id="6049">7	320	You and Dad were at the same place.</seg>
<seg id="6050">11	603	So, you know, sometimes you actually just try to put it aIso...</seg>
<seg id="6051">23	888	I have a problem. I'm with Sandy, but I can't stop talking about Judith.</seg>
<seg id="6052">9	394	It could be anywhere. - The music, the food the wine.</seg>
<seg id="6053">20	621	Honey, you don't remember him at all?</seg>
<seg id="6054">15	189	What? The air-conditioner's out of order</seg>
<seg id="6055">1	96	Stephanie -- we've all been praising Stephanie</seg>
<seg id="6056">46	322	The cult of Dionysus, the cult of the Egyptian goddess Isis, began to take hold, both for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="6057">27	374	Against the wall, all of you.</seg>
<seg id="6058">27	108	to Daras, hero of the Fatherland.</seg>
<seg id="6059">44	130	I think, in this case-that's not a term you throw around very loosely--of my friend and colleague, Ben Kiernan, whom some of you know, in his big book on genocide, which Yale Press published recently.</seg>
<seg id="6060">32	663	Leonard created an extremely expensive marketing campaign around this book...</seg>
<seg id="6061">31	133	You see, I am a good chingu.</seg>
<seg id="6062">6	114	But do not chase your dream further east,</seg>
<seg id="6063">22	7	Bandit One receiving signal. Approaching target vector.</seg>
<seg id="6064">42	68	I met with a surgeon last week--a good one.</seg>
<seg id="6065">15	226	The following morning he drove to work downtown</seg>
<seg id="6066">33	451	I heard they're called trumpet-pitchers. - Oh, that's right.</seg>
<seg id="6067">11	382	I got an e—mail from George Clooney...</seg>
<seg id="6068">22	526	...When the evac chopper went down, he probably got spooked.</seg>
<seg id="6069">5	1	At the end of the Kingdom of the United Shilla, the Royal family indulged in luxury and corruption, and the thanes brought about revolts and wars.</seg>
<seg id="6070">42	278	Yeah. Yeah, it's Nate. What's up?</seg>
<seg id="6071">47	314	The columns on the first story over here were Corinthian.</seg>
<seg id="6072">35	277	Go and have fun with your sister.</seg>
<seg id="6073">20	502	Do I really want to hear this? - My imaginary friend is not imaginary.</seg>
<seg id="6074">36	544	It was a fantasy for Christ's sake!</seg>
<seg id="6075">33	17	You don't call me nothin', nigger-lovin' Jew-boy. You just listen.</seg>
<seg id="6076">14	740	Plus Michel gets so cute when he feels he's overworked.</seg>
<seg id="6077">35	243	No. I am. I just find the whole arranged-marriage thing a little strange.</seg>
<seg id="6078">21	79	And now I kiss her, because she's in love with our new house.</seg>
<seg id="6079">45	96	We see again a podium that also has arches, as you can see, and then on the front of those arches, in this case, great pilasters.</seg>
<seg id="6080">42	22	You didn't have anthing to drink last night</seg>
<seg id="6081">14	45	Here's a card tray. Everything is gonna...</seg>
<seg id="6082">45	30	And you can see him in a no-nonsense, realistic portrait on that coin in the upper left.</seg>
<seg id="6083">23	924	It's aversion therapy. Wayne was trying to help me get over Judith so I had these things-- Nipples.</seg>
<seg id="6084">2	511	Can I just say, from the very beginning,</seg>
<seg id="6085">47	470	Remember, it's no longer--its original location--now it's over here, right next to the Mausoleum on the Tiber.</seg>
<seg id="6086">21	677	Well, at least nobody shot at us yet.</seg>
<seg id="6087">6	176	Were we gods, we would breach these walls into the eastern ocean.</seg>
<seg id="6088">9	370	Hey... "When the Saints Go Marching In".</seg>
<seg id="6089">15	188	It was all your fault. You damaged my car</seg>
<seg id="6090">46	129	She's also wearing a scarf that's tied back behind her head, and she too wears a laurel wreath over that scarf.</seg>
<seg id="6091">28	427	He could probably kill you in the blink of an eye.</seg>
<seg id="6092">2	832	Which, a lot of times, is okay as a leader.</seg>
<seg id="6093">50	188	Know what I did with the funeral donations?</seg>
<seg id="6094">2	953	When we -- you changed the concept we talked about.</seg>
<seg id="6095">46	469	As you can see down below, the hair is magnificently rendered.</seg>
<seg id="6096">13	727	Yeah? - Yeah, she was horrible.</seg>
<seg id="6097">45	50	So Vespasian also is a--with his son Titus-- is a victor in a foreign war, and that becomes the basis of their right to rule, and we'll see references to those Jewish Wars, in their art, even in our conversation today.</seg>
<seg id="6098">24	325	They terrorized the eastern seaboard for many years,</seg>
<seg id="6099">47	421	It's clearly a Second Style wall, residual First Style:</seg>
<seg id="6100">2	42	You know, I asked Brandy several times, you know, "help me, Brandy, because I need to know what women like."</seg>
<seg id="6101">44	338	Now, how did he become well known?</seg>
<seg id="6102">53	413	That's right, there are all kinds.</seg>
<seg id="6103">41	136	It's--it's supposed to be an aphrodisiac.</seg>
<seg id="6104">11	329	...To the protection and to the prevention of further crimes.</seg>
<seg id="6105">22	89	...From the private sector working at Kamshev...</seg>
<seg id="6106">45	339	The fact that that looked back to the architectural experiments, very early on, second, first centuries B. C. at the Sanctuaries of Jupiter Anxur at Terracina, and of Hercules Victor at Tivoli;</seg>
<seg id="6107">16	89	If you're referring to Declan, I don't think that's a concern</seg>
<seg id="6108">31	206	...you give us only evils to choose from.</seg>
<seg id="6109">37	786	Normally, I'd say "Let's stick some hash in the meatballs".</seg>
<seg id="6110">47	204	But you can see how small it is.</seg>
<seg id="6111">12	288	Jurgis showed me a picture of that broad...</seg>
<seg id="6112">25	381	With the money I make from that, I can buy an interest in a ship.</seg>
<seg id="6113">22	486	We need to know what happened on that evac.</seg>
<seg id="6114">5	227	The police executed a beggar for it, but I knew all along that the sons of the aristocracy were the ones who raped my wife.</seg>
<seg id="6115">1	195	So, I'm leaving you guys with a script.</seg>
<seg id="6116">1	179	It's a dark deconstruction of J. M. Barrie's "Peter Pan".</seg>
<seg id="6117">44	44	There was a real wave of opposition, for example, to imperialism that swept through Britain and London in 1900 in what they called the Khaki Election, khaki because it was the color of the uniforms of many of the British soldiers in hot climates.</seg>
<seg id="6118">47	138	Once they had formed the Second Triumvirate together,</seg>
<seg id="6119">42	392	I have reason to believe that my daughter is involved with someone else</seg>
<seg id="6120">7	971	Go on, Ted! You can't stop!</seg>
<seg id="6121">27	506	He may be drugged. We need McCoy.</seg>
<seg id="6122">15	80	Today's my graduation ceremony. Why dressed like that?</seg>
<seg id="6123">8	526	Yay! They did it! - My son!</seg>
<seg id="6124">25	790	Oh, yes, that might be so, but every one of them is a mother's son.</seg>
<seg id="6125">8	354	See? All you have to do is follow this tunnel and you'll be home in no time,</seg>
<seg id="6126">18	207	She wanted to escape the pressure, live some kind of life other than Latnok's experiment.</seg>
<seg id="6127">46	470	You can see that she has a bevy of corkscrew curls.</seg>
<seg id="6128">14	340	Keep up the good work. - I will.</seg>
<seg id="6129">47	135	And this 19-year-old upstart tried to overthrow Mark Antony, and he was not successful.</seg>
<seg id="6130">23	238	Come on. No, they're not that.</seg>
<seg id="6131">39	33	They were dating some blind guy. I don't want their pity.</seg>
<seg id="6132">19	119	you got a cigarette? - Yes, brother</seg>
<seg id="6133">46	342	I'm going to show you the so-called Odyssey paintings.</seg>
<seg id="6134">36	45	First, I'm proud to say that...</seg>
<seg id="6135">11	486	And therefore, the rebels would be exposed.</seg>
<seg id="6136">21	236	Yes, he is. He is a giant male reproductive organ.</seg>
<seg id="6137">5	87	How are living beings allowed in here?</seg>
<seg id="6138">13	250	Here's the dining room, the science hall, and the theater.</seg>
<seg id="6139">1	1003	I'd rather be fired tonight with clearing my name</seg>
<seg id="6140">44	300	The Mounted Police become a powerful, though somewhat tamer, more acceptable, more vanilla equivalent of that, of keeping order in Saskatoon and all of these places like that.</seg>
<seg id="6141">15	431	I don't mind. If only you're nice to Yu</seg>
<seg id="6142">45	214	Well we know that the architects of Nero did not use groin vaults, but they were very interested in the free flow of space, and that interest in the free flow of space continues here, as does experimentation with concrete, and we see it in the use of these groin vaults on the second story of the Colosseum in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="6143">7	547	...you have moments of such happiness...</seg>
<seg id="6144">2	987	Because when you were talking about not having content about flo tv right off the bat in the beginning,</seg>
<seg id="6145">1	965	He said, "over $1, 000." sir, let me tell you this.</seg>
<seg id="6146">16	111	Finally, I designed a chamber that I believed could work, and I invented a fluid that would provide oxygen and nourish the embryo placed inside</seg>
<seg id="6147">14	212	Bless you. I'm so exhausted, and I have to drive to Hartford tonight...</seg>
<seg id="6148">32	613	Ah, you wouldn't be the first.</seg>
<seg id="6149">45	315	And so I take us, back south, we go down south to Campania once again, to a place called Pozzuoli</seg>
<seg id="6150">45	464	Here's the knife to slit the throat of the animals; the pitcher to pour wine on an altar;</seg>
<seg id="6151">39	103	I arranged the corner table with Pietro. - Well, he did not tell me.</seg>
<seg id="6152">5	442	I wish with the power of the Consoling Tree, that your love lasts forever.</seg>
<seg id="6153">8	192	Do you think Max will be able to delay him for long?</seg>
<seg id="6154">18	216	But I'm supposed to go with - No, you need to come to my house now.</seg>
<seg id="6155">47	289	You can see a preserved capital, and how beautifully rendered they were: very high quality, capitals done out of Luna or Carrara marble.</seg>
<seg id="6156">2	523	And then we want to do a close-up of each person as they talk,</seg>
<seg id="6157">19	268	Ah, this zipper's broken. - What? Broken?</seg>
<seg id="6158">33	304	.are fixed on the search for the missing civil rights workers.</seg>
<seg id="6159">30	354	Saw them while trying to cut the throat</seg>
<seg id="6160">11	303	Not the list of the—— But just your own list that you're——</seg>
<seg id="6161">29	251	I always thought he was just trying to keep the children from straying far from our camp.</seg>
<seg id="6162">3	113	Chief Tung? What does he want?</seg>
<seg id="6163">39	18	[Larry] Danny, you know, i-i was tryin'to help you out, man.</seg>
<seg id="6164">20	585	Hold it! We need you to...</seg>
<seg id="6165">44	474	There was a caricature in the newspaper as Boy Scouts joined up along with lots of other people who weren't scouts in the war.</seg>
<seg id="6166">1	747	No, I said, walking in, I didn't know it was gonna</seg>
<seg id="6167">43	246	It's been a while, Det. Kang.</seg>
<seg id="6168">13	142	She's totally low maintenance. You know, like a Honda.</seg>
<seg id="6169">45	195	And clearly the experiments, the architectural experiments in the Augustan period, at the Theater of Marcellus, were very important in terms of this particular design;</seg>
<seg id="6170">18	329	The trick to getting votes is research and making sure everyone gets laid.</seg>
<seg id="6171">3	434	I'll say he fell in the sea.</seg>
<seg id="6172">17	400	But what you need to believe is that things will work themselves out...</seg>
<seg id="6173">16	471	The waste product of a failed experiment.</seg>
<seg id="6174">46	436	You remember the petrified bread that we looked at from Pompeii, and the division into shapes that make it resemble pizza.</seg>
<seg id="6175">39	17	It'll stop bleedin, you pussy. - [Groans]</seg>
<seg id="6176">1	415	David really sprung alive with the actors</seg>
<seg id="6177">23	747	You mean, like, a tall man? -Sure, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="6178">7	578	This is a big chance for me.</seg>
<seg id="6179">45	393	Here's another reconstruction. This one is from Ward-Perkins.</seg>
<seg id="6180">13	327	English culture also had its impact.</seg>
<seg id="6181">35	368	She's been trying to get him hitched to this rich New York girl for years.</seg>
<seg id="6182">29	545	Rodney, we're down to 2 minutes</seg>
<seg id="6183">14	693	You don't think I can do it. - You know that's not true.</seg>
<seg id="6184">47	192	And it was fairly easy to get this.</seg>
<seg id="6185">42	630	And despite what Nathan Stone h been alleged to have taken from Mr. Masters, it should be remembered what he gave back to Dina Allston.</seg>
<seg id="6186">45	404	I mentioned the great victory that Titus had over Jerusalem, a victory--at least from the Roman point of view it was great;</seg>
<seg id="6187">46	465	This is the first one that I want to show you, an absolutely fetching portrait of a young woman from Pompeii, that dates to around the middle of the first century A. D. that is, 45 to 50 A. D.</seg>
<seg id="6188">21	90	Yes! Yes! Make this woman the CEO of a multinational corporation.</seg>
<seg id="6189">8	308	Yes, that's true, but how did you know all that?</seg>
<seg id="6190">17	9	I don't wanna do it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="6191">50	264	You didn't want to go into aviation anyway.</seg>
<seg id="6192">31	67	...when and if you get captured by the enemy.</seg>
<seg id="6193">47	418	Here you can see the bull skulls or bucrania extremely well, and I thought you'd be interested to see, and perhaps not surprised, that we can see very close renditions of this also in painting of the time.</seg>
<seg id="6194">23	473	Dude, you don't have to do the sound. It already does that. Out.</seg>
<seg id="6195">11	567	What are you doing, Carlos, what's going on in your community?</seg>
<seg id="6196">21	339	No, no, don't disappear, lsabel. One more show.</seg>
<seg id="6197">8	291	Well, what did we expect? We've been gone for months,</seg>
<seg id="6198">11	247	We do have problems in terms of security.</seg>
<seg id="6199">15	362	Off now. Let me defecate, then get some sleep</seg>
<seg id="6200">47	50	He was not able to achieve architecturally all that he had hoped.</seg>
<seg id="6201">32	793	Think it's just waiting to burst out of you.</seg>
<seg id="6202">16	245	Why are you being so negative?</seg>
<seg id="6203">2	1032	Unless I could have drawn her a picture maybe in crayon.</seg>
<seg id="6204">47	31	Suetonius wrote a biography of the Twelve Caesars, a very famous biography that many of you may know served as the basis for Robert Graves'very well-known Claudius which also accentuates again the biographies of those first Twelve Caesars.</seg>
<seg id="6205">54	256	She loses guardianship. All of a sudden, house is a hero.</seg>
<seg id="6206">5	416	But they don't know this place, since it's considered to be nonexistent.</seg>
<seg id="6207">1	217	I want her to be able to recognize</seg>
<seg id="6208">1	158	I can do it. I'm gonna be project manager.</seg>
<seg id="6209">46	181	With regard to the scene of the satyrs, you can see that--the Silenus and the satyrs</seg>
<seg id="6210">27	702	Yes, let us make an example ...</seg>
<seg id="6211">47	66	This is a plan of the Forum of Julius Caesar, as it would have looked when the building was inaugurated in 46 B. C.</seg>
<seg id="6212">11	394	...And don't wanna do anything to threaten that relationship.</seg>
<seg id="6213">46	345	And while--I think I neglected to give you a date for the Mystery paintings, but those are 60 to 50, and these paintings are a little bit later, 50 to 40 B. C.</seg>
<seg id="6214">11	564	What is the most valuable action to enroll people, other people in our generation, to take action?</seg>
<seg id="6215">42	633	In the matter of Howard Masters vs. Nathan Stone,</seg>
<seg id="6216">11	647	Do you see the possibility of further names?</seg>
<seg id="6217">44	188	But there is a point to all of this, so the rest of this is about Baden-Powell and the Boy Scouts.</seg>
<seg id="6218">21	81	You're not in the scene? -No.</seg>
<seg id="6219">30	282	And according to what I know men cute do not walk out and about</seg>
<seg id="6220">21	437	That is the very definition of something going on.</seg>
<seg id="6221">28	96	You guys ? - Yeah, you know...</seg>
<seg id="6222">45	513	and then, most importantly, the frigidarium, that small, round building with radiating alcoves.</seg>
<seg id="6223">19	133	In the middle. Shit, now the guests will see it.</seg>
<seg id="6224">10	289	Oh, Jesus. Sorry. Here, you want some?</seg>
<seg id="6225">2	798	Now, all of a sudden, we're not working well together?</seg>
<seg id="6226">51	53	And I sure as hell ain't sorry I killed him.</seg>
<seg id="6227">29	151	Cokpit on their left the cokpit is regretably demolecularize, at the moment, but...</seg>
<seg id="6228">35	353	We sort of grew up together 'cause...</seg>
<seg id="6229">39	52	Not too loud though, okay? Something- - That's good, right?</seg>
<seg id="6230">45	517	there has been some speculation that Nero's Bath may have been the first example of the imperial plan, but we don't know for sure.</seg>
<seg id="6231">44	369	There's a slight problem with this invention of a term to describe himself as "the wolf who sneaks around",</seg>
<seg id="6232">16	235	Well, here's your chance to corrupt me - What is it? - Nothing</seg>
<seg id="6233">45	258	the popes did not hesitate to plunge the Colosseum for the marble that they needed for the buildings that they were putting up around Rome.</seg>
<seg id="6234">28	58	With all due respect, Sir, I hope you're not saying what I think you're saying.</seg>
<seg id="6235">51	441	Why didn't you just arrest him?</seg>
<seg id="6236">31	508	...to conduct a clandestine military operation.</seg>
<seg id="6237">23	442	Yeah, we know who he is, Clayton.</seg>
<seg id="6238">11	49	This is the sort of description of the burning of villages that some of the witnesses gave. —Amazing.</seg>
<seg id="6239">11	111	It wasn't so much when I was very young. I used to like racing motorcycles.</seg>
<seg id="6240">35	623	And what about you? Are you a loyal friend?</seg>
<seg id="6241">22	122	We had our asses kicked. - Oh, fuck that.</seg>
<seg id="6242">36	444	Until I know why that man tried to kill me, I'm trapped.</seg>
<seg id="6243">1	951	Now, I am not gonna be soiled by</seg>
<seg id="6244">37	829	Shall I come with you? - Yeah.</seg>
<seg id="6245">7	947	Last game of the season, they played...</seg>
<seg id="6246">2	851	I was -- I gave her her directions,</seg>
<seg id="6247">22	427	This is what's left of the chopper's operation recording.</seg>
<seg id="6248">14	502	You've missed the test. - No.</seg>
<seg id="6249">25	391	And a house to put it in. - Steady on.</seg>
<seg id="6250">11	150	We are African. As you've seen it from our skin.</seg>
<seg id="6251">47	411	Then above, also depicted in Carrara marble these great garlanded swags that you see hanging from pilasters but also from the skulls of bulls I'll show you a detail in a moment where you'll see those skulls better-- the skulls of the bulls that have been sacrificed on this altar.</seg>
<seg id="6252">29	38	Yes, ma'am I do. But we really don't have a choice in the matter</seg>
<seg id="6253">37	813	I dunno, Cass. I guess we're...</seg>
<seg id="6254">29	307	The thing practically strangled him to death</seg>
<seg id="6255">6	333	Then let them call me tyrant, in the main garden after my entry only,</seg>
<seg id="6256">6	158	Cooks and architects, doctors and somiers, money lenders and wives, children, lovers, whores.</seg>
<seg id="6257">47	473	It was put up right here, and it had in front of it an obelisk that was brought from Egypt, and that obelisk was part of a sundial that was orchestrated carefully enough so that the shadow from the sundial would fall exactly on the center of the Ara Pacis, on Augustus' birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6258">32	492	You get a cup of coffee.</seg>
<seg id="6259">23	926	No, you're obviously not ready for this relationship.</seg>
<seg id="6260">2	14	I'm sure my face didn't show it, but I was pissed.</seg>
<seg id="6261">22	184	Damn it, you can talk to me.</seg>
<seg id="6262">5	536	To give up your life for love is the easiest way.</seg>
<seg id="6263">45	492	The location of the Baths of Titus was next to</seg>
<seg id="6264">1	370	...of course, I want Nan first, single, center stage.</seg>
<seg id="6265">5	16	I thought I'd never find a demon slayer again.</seg>

<seg id="6566">47	393	We see here what is a restored view of the Altar of the Twelve Gods, or the Altar of Pity, that was located in the Greek marketplace, in Athens, the Athenian Agora, the marketplace in Athens, fifth century B. C.</seg>
<seg id="6567">14	318	And now I've told you a story that would so mortify her...</seg>
<seg id="6568">47	325	He did not like seeing these in disrepair, and in fact he had his own architects replace one of them with a Roman copy, and while they were doing that, they made plaster casts of these maidens, they brought those plaster casts back to Rome, and then in reduced scale they duplicated them for the Forum of Augustus in Rome.</seg>

<seg id="6595">47	198	And there are some amazing, amazing works of art, we might call them, that come out of these competitions.</seg>
<seg id="6596">46	385	But most interesting of all, for us aficionados of the Second Style, is the fact that very careful</seg>

<seg id="6681">36	342	Since you almost ran us off the road, I'm wondering what it is...</seg>
<seg id="6682">20	282	Because I know about Elizabeth's situation, and I just wanna say that...</seg>
<seg id="6683">37	911	On the book: I went to the flotting harbar, I saw a boat. The boat was big.</seg>
<seg id="6684">45	332	But you can also see there was a big open area in the center that was also used-- covered over, when there was an event-- but that was also there in order to allow a freer flow, and allow the attendants to bring the animals up to the top.</seg>

<seg id="6696">54	377	I know whatshe's gonna say. She's gonna lieto save her business.</seg>
<seg id="6697">46	44	And you can also see that this is like nothing we've looked at thus far this semester, in that what we have here are a series of very large, monumental figures that seem to walk around the room in a kind of procession, and you see those extremely well here.</seg>
<seg id="6698">54	471	Means that thanks to cuddy'scandy-ass approach broad-spectrum antibioticsare no longer an option.</seg>

<seg id="6718">35	236	Well. that's pretty bad when you put it like that.</seg>
<seg id="6719">44	28	I said in what you're reading that if you get Karl Marx, if he ever sat together with Hobson, a very major economic thinker whom I describe in there, if they were having dinner, there would be a lot that was uncomfortable about the dinner.</seg>
<seg id="6720">45	493	actually what you see here, on top of the Golden House, is actually the plan of a later bath, the Baths of the emperor Trajan, which we'll look at in the future.</seg>

<seg id="6724">16	36	It's okay. It's just another dream</seg>
<seg id="6725">2	206	And she's been like this the entire competition.</seg>
<seg id="6726">31	176	lf it's this or a surgicaI strike...</seg>
<seg id="6727">50	282	Hello. - Got a place for them to sleep?</seg>
<seg id="6728">7	949	The Bears had to beat the Cardinals to win.</seg>
<seg id="6729">18	418	It's just -- it's a technicality.</seg>
<seg id="6730">15	199	Never mind those men. Let me show you the kitchen</seg>
<seg id="6731">15	499	Piglet, I can wait for 10 years, 20 years</seg>
<seg id="6732">23	660	For God's sakes, when will you give up this idea that I'll go out with Sandy?</seg>
<seg id="6733">54	32	I'm not mrs. Hartmann. We're divorced.</seg>
<seg id="6734">25	799	I promise you we'll get out of this, all right?</seg>
<seg id="6735">27	21	The Zeons do have a crude interplanetary capability.</seg>
<seg id="6736">14	325	I hope Rory adjusts to this place. We need her here.</seg>
<seg id="6737">20	414	The only thing to do was to burn my scores and drink margaritas.</seg>
<seg id="6738">46	116	The beginning of another scene here, with a series of women</seg>
<seg id="6739">15	765	What a coincidence It's been a long time</seg>
<seg id="6740">29	478	So, what I wanted to say was...</seg>
<seg id="6741">9	316	Up here, you can see the Eiffel Tower. Look</seg>
<seg id="6742">21	859	Abner, come look! The new neighbors are moving in!</seg>
<seg id="6743">46	234	We see down below a basket that is certainly the basket in which the phallus, the secret ritual</seg>
<seg id="6744">30	37	Are you going to do that?</seg>
<seg id="6745">9	510	You must let me go. I'm an American.</seg>
<seg id="6746">45	356	And that street, the Argiletum--and you can see it labeled up there</seg>
<seg id="6747">28	238	Well, as a matter of fact, I, um... wait a minute. See, why would you say that now?</seg>
<seg id="6748">31	406	Brevity code Allison! Stand down! I repeat, stand down!</seg>
<seg id="6749">43	578	You'll know when you come. And you must come alone.</seg>
<seg id="6750">14	40	but we caught them trying to shove themselves in the pencil sharpener.</seg>
<seg id="6751">21	45	Randall, take that stupid sign off that machine.</seg>
<seg id="6752">42	264	You seem really out of it. - I-I'm fine.</seg>
<seg id="6753">51	16	Retirement seemed to work out for Buckley.</seg>
<seg id="6754">46	353	We see, in fact, that several scouts, working for Odysseus, get off their boats on an island and they come across this beautiful young woman who has just fetched-- you can see she's holding a pitcher</seg>
<seg id="6755">30	206	Who are you and how do you know Vaylard?</seg>
<seg id="6756">1	609	I had trouble following it. Did you?</seg>
<seg id="6757">16	397	I have an obligation to protect you.</seg>
<seg id="6758">8	261	each day sinking a little further into anger and depression until you began keeping company with the worst kind of insects</seg>
<seg id="6759">32	760	Human beings can be kinda cruel...</seg>
<seg id="6760">1	304	Mm-hmm. And it's looking out, and she's sitting</seg>
<seg id="6761">6	17	Which is not to say I won't take a Macedonian one day.</seg>
<seg id="6762">42	680	But it's pretty amazing almost makes me wish it would happen to me</seg>
<seg id="6763">6	60	Better than you really are, in you and those like you is this.</seg>
<seg id="6764">9	462	Before, when we would make a bomb, to blow up a cafe or something, it would cost us a week's wage working at the fucking newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="6765">14	259	but it will be important when your kids hit their universities.</seg>
<seg id="6766">1	51	It was a group decision to go to wall street.</seg>
<seg id="6767">1	64	She doesn't have anything interesting to say, so shut up.</seg>
<seg id="6768">35	20	l told you. Lakhi. It's very vulgar.</seg>
<seg id="6769">31	303	These workers, why are they wearing these uniforms?</seg>
<seg id="6770">31	52	Sir, it is what it is. And these are good numbers.</seg>
<seg id="6771">42	403	I'm not entirely sure that's any of your business, Eli.</seg>
<seg id="6772">33	6	What the fuck are they playin' at? - They ain't playin'. You better believe it.</seg>
<seg id="6773">18	41	And I'm sure Adam's explanation preserved his belief in Latnok's noble intentions.</seg>
<seg id="6774">22	232	Jacks here. - What is happening now?</seg>
<seg id="6775">53	128	Maybe curry curry? I want curry! Save me some curry please</seg>
<seg id="6776">23	814	No, I'm gay. Judith got me in touch with the inner J.D.</seg>
<seg id="6777">2	663	And it's tough -- I knew going into it</seg>
<seg id="6778">51	540	just like when that cop got beat down.</seg>
<seg id="6779">15	148	I wanted to marry Li, but she turned me down</seg>
<seg id="6780">42	332	Whether I was or I wasn't, I still met Sean.</seg>
<seg id="6781">11	183	So we're gonna use the weight of billions and billions of dollars of state pension fund money as financial leverage on the Sudanese government.</seg>
<seg id="6782">28	316	Well, he was running from the Wraith when I killed the sucker.</seg>
<seg id="6783">43	409	According to the D. A's report, ...the amount of drug confiscated with Sang-tae's arrest...</seg>
<seg id="6784">1	700	It was Mahsa and Stephanie who</seg>
<seg id="6785">27	785	Indeed. With the union of two cultures, this system would make a fine addition to the Federation.</seg>
<seg id="6786">43	644	I didn't plan to kill her.</seg>
<seg id="6787">35	48	They own hotels all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="6788">25	463	Is there anyone else on this island?</seg>
<seg id="6789">15	326	What is this strange girl up to?</seg>
<seg id="6790">5	262	They had the power to raise the revolt by using the demons.</seg>
<seg id="6791">1	371	Are we putting david in charge of handling this performance and directing it?</seg>
<seg id="6792">46	371	I mentioned already that it is believed that these paintings on the Esquiline Hill are based on Hellenistic Greek models that probably were made in about 150 B. C.</seg>
<seg id="6793">42	297	George Michael asked me to represent him last week.</seg>
<seg id="6794">43	248	Wow, I'm hurt. You forgot my voice already?</seg>
<seg id="6795">18	172	She of hamburgers and hippie skirts, has decided she wants to go.</seg>
<seg id="6796">13	108	but she'll answer to either one or even "Hey, you" depending on...</seg>
<seg id="6797">11	104	People that don't eat will try to find it some way.</seg>
<seg id="6798">22	54	...But it is capable of going online if it is re-cored.</seg>
<seg id="6799">29	442	It reacted to either the salt or the water.</seg>
<seg id="6800">46	23	You see it right over here.</seg>
<seg id="6801">31	171	...the South Koreans have Patriot batteries along the line.</seg>
<seg id="6802">42	580	You told Eli about me and Matt.</seg>
<seg id="6803">30	692	So I asked him to find me on the heart</seg>
<seg id="6804">23	772	I always knew I was different, and now I know why.</seg>
<seg id="6805">24	72	And now without the attendance of the magistrate...</seg>
<seg id="6806">29	74	This is Ford, good to hear your voice</seg>
<seg id="6807">7	240	That's why you're my man, kiddo.</seg>
<seg id="6808">19	222	Oh well, whatever makes you happy works for me.</seg>
<seg id="6809">20	162	Do you... wanna take some kind of medication first?</seg>
<seg id="6810">17	41	I had to get home before they knew I was gone.</seg>
<seg id="6811">5	34	You're supposed to clean yourself at the Tanchi Bath first.</seg>
<seg id="6812">46	2	And we're going to look at them both in the context of the architectural style walls that we've been discussing thus far this term, especially the Second,</seg>
<seg id="6813">21	70	Is it just my imagination, or is the room actually brighter with her here?</seg>
<seg id="6814">30	507	Was a dumb idea to take them there</seg>
<seg id="6815">11	562	...So that people cannot say, "I was unaware.</seg>
<seg id="6816">42	229	You looked me in the eye, and you told me Karen was next.</seg>
<seg id="6817">27	686	Then Melakon began to take over.</seg>
<seg id="6818">9	543	Good job, man, good job. - Open.</seg>
<seg id="6819">15	655	Luckily you brought him here in time. He could've got meningitis</seg>
<seg id="6820">47	81	Prof: Storage did you say, or-- Student: Storage.</seg>
<seg id="6821">42	625	These are not decisions that anyone should have to make, yet doctors are asked to make them every day.</seg>
<seg id="6822">35	131	God knows they'll need to. 'cos we can't afford to give them all decent dowries.</seg>
<seg id="6823">31	271	Captain chung, I am Ambassador Li Sung Park.</seg>
<seg id="6824">50	220	Even if they do, it's no use. They won't care anyway.</seg>
<seg id="6825">34	502	I went to pick up some fabric, and then we went to Libbys.</seg>
<seg id="6826">33	491	If the entire Secret Service couldn't protect the president,...</seg>
<seg id="6827">54	59	Then move ontoyour secret secret stash. - I ran out.</seg>
<seg id="6828">53	199	I want to go to school school? You wouldn't have any fun at school besides, when you don't have a daddy, they bully you at school</seg>
<seg id="6829">11	660	Guys, look. This is what Daddy is doing.</seg>
<seg id="6830">31	146	So here's what the South Koreans are saying:</seg>
<seg id="6831">1	1049	That's too bad, but that's the way it goes.</seg>
<seg id="6832">46	33	You see it right to the right of the tablinum, and close to the southern side, close to the great bay window that was added in Phase Two to provide magnificent views out over the sea.</seg>
<seg id="6833">6	629	But the glory and memory of man will always belong to the one's who follow their  visions,</seg>
<seg id="6834">28	307	McKay, I'm telling you, it's the key to defeating them!</seg>
<seg id="6835">6	319	Which one day you will have.</seg>
<seg id="6836">22	485	That's the best you're gonna get. - It's not enough.</seg>
<seg id="6837">19	128	It's me, So- and- So. - Oh, you're here?</seg>
<seg id="6838">43	397	I don't even know what's going to happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="6839">30	638	Are you his friend or his brother?</seg>
<seg id="6840">42	215	You described your build as "athletic.</seg>
<seg id="6841">15	96	Ready. Buddy, take one for me first</seg>
<seg id="6842">8	25	It's like a gamallus, only much, much bigger, - Beta, I'm gonna need your knife, - Comin' right up,</seg>
<seg id="6843">18	441	The whole thing has just left me feeling sort of.</seg>
<seg id="6844">23	291	I only have a minute. I have to wax Judith's legs.</seg>
<seg id="6845">43	558	Since the lower torso has already been paralyzed, it has been about 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="6846">45	240	It is not as well preserved as the exterior.</seg>
<seg id="6847">18	257	Hello? I won? - That's right.</seg>
<seg id="6848">8	168	Hey, they're puttin' up a good fight, Let's see if they've got the groove,</seg>
<seg id="6849">29	132	Keep a channel open with them all the times</seg>
<seg id="6850">12	43	Do you know who Susan Hoff is?</seg>
<seg id="6851">22	661	They used the hostages to re-core the third reactor before we got here.</seg>
<seg id="6852">3	284	I'll shoot you if you still refuse to talk.</seg>
<seg id="6853">17	55	Stephen took him to take his driver's test this morning.</seg>
<seg id="6854">46	316	probably the wife of the man who owned and built the Villa of the Mysteries in Pompeii, who was herself an adherent to the cult of Dionysus, and has set aside this secret room in her house for the cult of Dionysus in which she can help initiate other young women into this mystery cult.</seg>
<seg id="6855">50	85	A swordsman is not affected by space.</seg>
<seg id="6856">24	83	With that ungrateful husband of hers.</seg>
<seg id="6857">42	122	That didn't seem to stop you and Stone.</seg>
<seg id="6858">13	181	Then two left for the French Club after seeing Schindler's List.</seg>
<seg id="6859">15	540	Bitch, you know he's my husband</seg>
<seg id="6860">18	324	You know you want to vote Hillary for prom queen?</seg>
<seg id="6861">35	256	What l was trying to say is that he wanted a bride who was traditional and...</seg>
<seg id="6862">21	19	Just a little one. -Aunt Clara.</seg>
<seg id="6863">13	705	Yeah? Add a couple plaid skirts, and you've got the Chilton freaks.</seg>
<seg id="6864">23	1138	She's a stripper. -And a hooker.</seg>
<seg id="6865">16	44	I'll answer all of your questions...</seg>
<seg id="6866">27	172	I'll tell your Fuhrer everything he wants to know.</seg>
<seg id="6867">29	150	But, if you know some way of mannually crack the mechanism ...</seg>
<seg id="6868">54	341	Let's not go broad-spectrum. Let's not take any chancesof actually curing her.</seg>
<seg id="6869">6	184	Yes, I have Babylon, but each land, each boundary I cross,</seg>
<seg id="6870">51	581	...we'll see when it's all over.</seg>
<seg id="6871">11	480	And the reaction of the government and the Janjaweed...</seg>
<seg id="6872">47	449	It ended up beneath a palace in the Renaissance period, and at that time some pieces of it were taken apart and made their way to museums in Rome, but also to museums as far away as Paris.</seg>
<seg id="6873">45	52	and that's in fact what we're going to see him doing today-- and he starts this from the very beginning of his reign.</seg>
<seg id="6874">45	329	And here you can see the very well-preserved pavement of the arena, done in concrete, with these openings in it, the same openings that you saw just before, from down below, through which the light came.</seg>
<seg id="6875">35	552	I think we can take him to the Garba tonight. no. Mama?</seg>
<seg id="6876">8	428	Heaven knows I don't care about titles and honors, but I must admit that it does feel good to be supreme ruler!</seg>
<seg id="6877">10	478	Went To Park With Jake. Maggie.</seg>
<seg id="6878">15	6	I actually subsisted on my father's money</seg>
<seg id="6879">30	394	You better move away from here before they hurt you</seg>
<seg id="6880">51	325	The department offered him a suspension, disciplinary action.</seg>
<seg id="6881">23	125	I don't want to meet him. -Great.</seg>
<seg id="6882">50	103	I have to work for a living now.</seg>
<seg id="6883">29	174	When he shuts down entire forward section, along with the men inside will cease to exist</seg>
<seg id="6884">8	347	We're going to drown them, pulverize them, and destroy them, forever,</seg>
<seg id="6885">42	142	Right, and Karen was first on the transplant list when a donor heart became available.</seg>
<seg id="6886">18	563	But I just assumed that - that it was this whole archaic thing where you save your lunch money and mow extra lawns to take me out because you think I'm pretty?</seg>
<seg id="6887">33	446	That means that I don't have an excuse for hanging around here any more.</seg>
<seg id="6888">41	69	Next item, United States vs. Solinksy, et al.</seg>
<seg id="6889">33	127	Did you report this to the police?</seg>
<seg id="6890">11	167	There is one interesting piece of evidence in Geneina...</seg>
<seg id="6891">22	597	Hi. The radiation suits are in the car.</seg>
<seg id="6892">34	440	My grandfather told me that the smoke of the burned choya's purifies.</seg>
<seg id="6893">11	513	It doesn't matter how far you've gotten in the legislature...</seg>
<seg id="6894">32	705	Hey, Harlee, just stay there. Stay in the car, okay?</seg>
<seg id="6895">44	87	It's fun to talk about, sad but also fun.</seg>
<seg id="6896">21	487	And I'm moving out of the house this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="6897">18	481	I'm more worried that if she does come, it won't be enough.</seg>
<seg id="6898">50	347	You're not even my mom, so why the fuck did you?</seg>
<seg id="6899">42	678	Then what do you think is happening?</seg>
<seg id="6900">30	626	Which means he will not feel any of the things</seg>
<seg id="6901">31	444	...this tribunal has reached its verdict.</seg>
<seg id="6902">22	519	It's not happening, Amanda. - You heard what he said.</seg>
<seg id="6903">33	140	What is it? - There you are, nigger trash!</seg>
<seg id="6904">27	56	The other planet, Zeon, has a relatively high technology, and its people are peaceful.</seg>
<seg id="6905">11	43	...And we've just fallen flat on our faces.</seg>
<seg id="6906">39	366	if it wasn't for brave young men like Danny...</seg>
<seg id="6907">5	446	The spirit finally left this world and his mother was consoled, but they said that Yon-hwa called the ghosts to the village.</seg>
<seg id="6908">1	903	And you're telling me that you knew you lost</seg>
<seg id="6909">9	328	I will tell you later. Okay? Couilles.</seg>
<seg id="6910">16	298	Kyle. It's okay. Come on in</seg>
<seg id="6911">11	244	Because your soul's gonna be touched.</seg>
<seg id="6912">22	68	That is to say, potentially 100, 000 deaths in an instant.</seg>
<seg id="6913">29	108	Yeah, but the Wraith's hibernate for centuries, right?</seg>
<seg id="6914">45	265	The arena would have been paved with concrete--we have other examples of that elsewhere; I'm going to show you one today</seg>
<seg id="6915">17	361	That's a huge lift to both our social lives.</seg>
<seg id="6916">2	926	This is a consistent thing that I've seen,</seg>
<seg id="6917">6	326	Bring the rest of the guard.</seg>
<seg id="6918">30	490	As you can see the impact of the disease in most his body when he died</seg>
<seg id="6919">35	99	Why don't we just alert the media?</seg>
<seg id="6920">55	297	You believed me-means you're not sure House did it.</seg>
<seg id="6921">1	365	It's -- I think what you do is you have connection through the whole thing,</seg>
<seg id="6922">15	933	We must go out on duty, darling. Let's go</seg>
<seg id="6923">25	647	That depends on what the charge is.</seg>
<seg id="6924">27	721	The Deputy Fuhrer is an authority on the genetics of racial purity.</seg>
<seg id="6925">50	309	Since there's no grown-up at home, he's probably outside all the time.</seg>
<seg id="6926">7	990	Then he was gone again, back to the North where he came from.</seg>
<seg id="6927">46	351	I put that name on the Monument List for you-- the Laestrygonians, and what happens when he meets the Laestrygonians.</seg>
<seg id="6928">23	293	I know, I'm sorry but I've just been so happy spending time with Judith.</seg>
<seg id="6929">36	575	I did nothing of the kind. - They tapped your phone.</seg>
<seg id="6930">43	426	Don't insult Det. Kang because he isn't here.</seg>
<seg id="6931">47	70	But it also was based in part on a building that we have not looked at and which no longer survives, but we have information about, and that is that Caesareum, or Caesareum of Julius Caesar, that he and Cleopatra put up in Alexandria.</seg>
<seg id="6932">7	182	What? -I gave him a couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="6933">44	154	It's easy to say how terrible this is, but it is terrible.</seg>
<seg id="6934">41	621	Thank you, Maggie. - you're welcome.</seg>
<seg id="6935">44	116	Gradually they expand their control over Algeria.</seg>
<seg id="6936">46	439	But paintings like this we believe</seg>
<seg id="6937">33	315	I'll tell you something else. I think it's a stunt dreamed up by NAAC people.</seg>
<seg id="6938">32	368	And turned to their soldiers instructing...</seg>
<seg id="6939">28	106	he would talk of how you could sever a man's torso with a P-90!</seg>
<seg id="6940">18	320	No. No one would want to take me.</seg>
<seg id="6941">31	512	...a secret facility thought to have an underground missilefiring system...</seg>
<seg id="6942">54	96	You think maybe we shouldget a second opinion before we start removingour child's organs?</seg>
<seg id="6943">11	367	Give yourself credit. You've come a long way.</seg>
<seg id="6944">13	394	Who? - The other moms, the headmaster.</seg>
<seg id="6945">27	316	They're on their way to the laboratory, for experimental work.</seg>
<seg id="6946">33	266	It ain't right having blood on Main Street. How'd that look on the TV news?</seg>
<seg id="6947">1	388	But we have to explain it</seg>
<seg id="6948">44	293	And she's there with all the others.</seg>
<seg id="6949">25	366	From the kissing rocks "to the highest peak.</seg>
<seg id="6950">16	180	The glass is just a container</seg>
<seg id="6951">31	45	Sir, as of 0900 this morning...</seg>
<seg id="6952">33	193	Two hundred, maybe. More in the balcony.</seg>
<seg id="6953">32	321	And I wanted people to like me...</seg>
<seg id="6954">45	392	We actually think it may have been used as a museum, as a museum, and I'm going to say more about that in a moment.</seg>
<seg id="6955">35	310	I'm not surprised Mr. Darcy hasn't found his ideal woman with a list like that.</seg>

<seg id="6960">29	79	Teyla, doctor McKay and myself are in the rear compartment with the major.</seg>
<seg id="6961">17	359	Kyle, I'm not sensing your excitement here.</seg>
<seg id="6962">46	228	And so this is a very important message, I think, of hope to those women who were hoping to become initiates of this particular cult.</seg>
<seg id="6963">35	425	From small, great caterpillars to such beautiful butterflies.</seg>
<seg id="6964">36	43	I would like to share with you just a few things about myself.</seg>
<seg id="6965">6	169	Yes I do, that when we reach these heights,</seg>
<seg id="6966">24	188	Three moons past, I fought Arnoch of Tarquinii.</seg>
<seg id="6967">13	741	No. No way. - No way, what?</seg>
<seg id="6968">43	561	Everybody just stay low, until contact you again!</seg>
<seg id="6969">27	472	Very good. We may make a human of you yet.</seg>
<seg id="6970">18	479	You think she may not come?</seg>
<seg id="6971">35	598	There must be something magical in the water in Amritsar.</seg>
<seg id="6972">25	66	Why does he talk like that?</seg>
<seg id="6973">47	12	He then joined with Pompey the Great, and with a man by the name of Crassus, to form what is known as the First Triumvirate.</seg>
<seg id="6974">16	69	There've always been rumors that Einstein conducted a series of secret experiments in the 1920s</seg>

<seg id="6976">44	152	These are my words to the Herero people.</seg>
<seg id="6977">9	689	C'mon, we'll be safer in here.</seg>
<seg id="6978">42	522	Give my dad this kid's heart?</seg>
<seg id="6979">13	260	I already had the longest day of my life, and it's only 10: 00. How nice.</seg>
<seg id="6980">8	304	Even how to cook garden peas,</seg>
<seg id="6981">31	369	Mr. President, to make our window, we have to put the B2's at okinawa...</seg>
<seg id="6982">14	440	You got the 16 part right. - I was off by 75 years.</seg>
<seg id="6983">23	181	I think-- I mean, you're-- it's best.</seg>
<seg id="6984">21	530	Oh, yes. Would you like one?</seg>
<seg id="6985">18	653	No. Don't pity me! - We don't.</seg>
<seg id="6986">44	208	He said,"The shape of a face gives a good guide to a man's character," this sort of firm face.</seg>
<seg id="6987">47	397	And tradition had it that when the doors--because it had double doors; well it had two sides because he was a two-headed god.</seg>
<seg id="6988">36	23	It was the first Nativity where Joseph stares at the wise men's tits.</seg>
<seg id="6989">22	512	I mean, what the fuck is going on here, captain?</seg>
<seg id="6990">11	266	...Convinced a few more people that divestment's a good idea...</seg>
<seg id="6991">45	304	but if you're going to be making your way to the Colosseum anytime soon, or in the future, it's actually not a bad idea to go online;</seg>
<seg id="6992">23	766	Tomorrow I have a test in my catechism class and I have to score at least an 85 so I can take my vows on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="6993">18	247	It might be best for the two of you to meet someplace quiet, safe.</seg>

<seg id="7003">35	187	We'll darken your lifeline to deepen with time</seg>
<seg id="7004">47	359	If you were allowed to walk into the temple, which usually only the priests could do, you would see the cult statue with Mars Ultor in the center there.</seg>
<seg id="7005">25	462	so mr. Crusoe, so full of surprises.</seg>
<seg id="7006">54	522	Maybe my wanting to be a motheris like a tone deaf personwanting to sing opera - or a paraplegicwho wants to-- - whoa, whoa, whoa.</seg>
<seg id="7007">46	101	Here is somebody, I believe, who has really looked at human beings, who has really looked at the way in which hair grows from the scalp, because you can see the way in which he has shown that hair growing from the scalp, and he understands that when you part your hair in the middle, there may be a certain part of the scalp that you actually see through the hair, and he has represented that extremely realistically here.</seg>
<seg id="7008">14	51	Look at the large red circles around various parts of your papers...</seg>
<seg id="7009">31	91	I told him that you are Lieutenant Robert James...</seg>
<seg id="7010">11	490	Ali Kushayb's name comes up consistently amongst witnesses...</seg>
<seg id="7011">25	465	What about your savage? Any more like him?</seg>
<seg id="7012">1	165	And hopefully try to pull the team together</seg>
<seg id="7013">33	499	Are you, sir, a spokesman for the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan?</seg>
<seg id="7014">3	331	Officer Ma, we have to work according to the rules.</seg>
<seg id="7015">25	52	There's a-- there's a conquistador's gold on the island.</seg>
<seg id="7016">43	318	There was a strange man saying he was a relative.</seg>
<seg id="7017">45	180	So if you are in any--we used to have a Colosseum here, in New Haven--but if you are, in the future, in any arenas that are called Colosseums, you'll know that that name goes back to the Colossus of Nero, the Colossus of Sol, not to the Colosseum itself, ultimately.</seg>
<seg id="7018">18	609	Maybe you'd like to come back in for a while?</seg>
<seg id="7019">46	70	The artist has paid a great deal of attention to that veil, because he wants to identify her for us, and to tell us that she is a bride.</seg>
<seg id="7020">28	33	The enzyme sac under the right arm has been removed.</seg>
<seg id="7021">24	411	You know they should learn to appreciate</seg>
<seg id="7022">13	708	What about, on Tuesdays and Thursdays...</seg>
<seg id="7023">44	420	You could send a postcard home.</seg>
<seg id="7024">47	283	This is a restored view in the Ward-Perkins textbook, which shows you what the temple would have looked like in antiquity, when it was in its final form, and you can see everything we've described: the tall podium, single staircase, facade orientation.</seg>
<seg id="7025">17	446	You just-- You keep trying, do your best.</seg>
<seg id="7026">15	130	I want you to play a couple, it's play acting only</seg>
<seg id="7027">51	384	Why are you still here then?</seg>
<seg id="7028">45	124	F-o-r-m-a, new word, U-r-b-i-s, the Forma Urbis--which was a marble plan of Rome, that was made in the early third century A. D. which was housed in a building that I'm going to show you later today.</seg>
<seg id="7029">22	198	Those deaths are in the past. Leave them behind.</seg>
<seg id="7030">27	645	If you can't, Bones, you'll have to use a stronger stimulant, no matter what it does.</seg>
<seg id="7031">39	146	Oh- [Gasping] - Oh, my God, I am so sorry. Oh, my God. Are you all right?</seg>
<seg id="7032">19	205	It's good Iuck, saying you will reunite with your Iost ones.</seg>
<seg id="7033">20	45	I hope you feel better. - Get well soon.</seg>
<seg id="7034">31	202	Mr. President, 3. 5 million North Koreans...</seg>
<seg id="7035">14	582	My sister took my report to school instead of hers.</seg>
<seg id="7036">46	291	She is again accompanied by another woman, an attendant, and the two of them together are actually fixing her hair, to get her ready again for her mystical marriage-- I have a detail of her to show you in a moment.</seg>
<seg id="7037">44	368	So, he became "the wolf who never sleeps”.</seg>
<seg id="7038">29	359	I accept that. In fact, I respect that.</seg>
<seg id="7039">27	504	Yes. That may be part of the plan, the semi divine detachment.</seg>
<seg id="7040">25	446	If you can guarantee me Crusoe's safety, I'll tell you what they're looking for.</seg>
<seg id="7041">39	169	[Continues] - Thank you for calling, Doctor.</seg>
<seg id="7042">15	81	Oh, sorry, all because of that mad man</seg>
<seg id="7043">11	602	...We did the same thing to millions of people in ovens.</seg>
<seg id="7044">46	387	They did that first, they copied--so we had a continuous landscape scene, and it was only after that landscape scene was painted that the artists went back and painted the columns on top.</seg>
<seg id="7045">13	265	This is a jumbo coffee morning. I need coffee in an I. V.</seg>
<seg id="7046">17	225	I mean, you're here all alone, and this neighborhood seems kind of</seg>
<seg id="7047">22	205	They are asking for us to counter with a ground attack.</seg>
<seg id="7048">30	100	There is something else as well</seg>
<seg id="7049">29	343	You do not know this. But among our people, there is a ritual prayer that is said, when one knows that death is upon them.</seg>
<seg id="7050">2	719	They also thought you had really good energy,</seg>
<seg id="7051">32	617	This is the first draft of his new book.</seg>
<seg id="7052">28	516	You... you can't kill an unarmed upside down man!</seg>
<seg id="7053">17	433	And you were just so warm.</seg>
<seg id="7054">35	170	Life is great. let's celebrate the sacred union two souls have found</seg>
<seg id="7055">54	496	What I meant by"are you okay"? Is what the helldid house do?</seg>
<seg id="7056">43	316	Has anybody visited my wife recently?</seg>
<seg id="7057">27	118	What kind of monsters are the Zeons sending against us?</seg>
<seg id="7058">11	560	...But we told them that whether he signs it or not, we'll know...</seg>
<seg id="7059">1	778	The president and C. E.O. Of Snapple</seg>
<seg id="7060">12	410	It's hot. Hold on one second.</seg>
<seg id="7061">46	100	It's the same as I mentioned when we talked about the gardenscape of Livia, and I said that that artist had clearly looked at nature and was actually depicting what he saw and knew about nature.</seg>
<seg id="7062">33	500	I told you. I'm a businessman.</seg>
<seg id="7063">2	853	...and order food for the models.</seg>
<seg id="7064">39	198	[Sighs] All right. Danny, just tell me what the problem is.</seg>
<seg id="7065">42	478	I have affidavits from ten past and present colleagues, professors and friends, all stating how deeply you resented your father for his drinking.</seg>
<seg id="7066">31	28	lt won't be hundreds of thousands. That wilI be all, general.</seg>
<seg id="7067">20	239	And they're willing to give you a nice long lease.</seg>
<seg id="7068">51	176	Rose, we had a visitor. Gabriel.</seg>
<seg id="7069">47	46	He built, or he began to build, a highway from the Adriatic across the Apennines, to the Tiber, and then most famously a canal cut through the Isthmus of Corinth.</seg>
<seg id="7070">35	134	Did I tell you about this Indian fellow who went to America and made it rich?</seg>
<seg id="7071">27	192	Excellency, give me a few minutes with them.</seg>
<seg id="7072">53	115	What a great idea put him there when he's noisy, ok?</seg>
<seg id="7073">22	479	What makes you think he will come here...</seg>
<seg id="7074">11	77	And then you start feeling like:</seg>
<seg id="7075">8	374	I do love something to nibble on during a good show,</seg>
<seg id="7076">2	367	He sees this new flo tv that his daughter's using</seg>
<seg id="7077">36	634	And a picture of what looks like a man's penis.</seg>
<seg id="7078">51	468	I see you got my message.</seg>
<seg id="7079">53	98	Don't go out with her, Shigeru</seg>
<seg id="7080">6	152	That love eluded Alexander as much if not more, than finding the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="7081">2	444	And everyone's like, "yeah, we won."</seg>
<seg id="7082">51	568	LT is with Rose. LT has a mild concussion.</seg>
<seg id="7083">6	67	Some say it was for alliance with the tribes,</seg>
<seg id="7084">47	339	And then over here, a reclining figure of the Tiber River, the river on which Rome was built.</seg>
<seg id="7085">15	760	What about the set dinner for lovers?</seg>
<seg id="7086">21	749	Oh, Uncle Arthur. You're my favorite character.</seg>
<seg id="7087">28	146	Look, I know there's not enough for us all, but we can take turns.</seg>
<seg id="7088">47	326	So appropriations from Greece; appropriations in part because Augustus liked them, but also I don't think there's any question that he was trying to draw a relationship between himself his new Golden Age, and the Golden Age of Periclean Athens.</seg>
<seg id="7089">35	306	Let me see: she has to be smart. speak several languages...</seg>
<seg id="7090">39	116	Look. I don't know what's going on ex</seg>
<seg id="7091">25	754	Give up the gold and I'll make sure you live.</seg>
<seg id="7092">15	808	She's the impulsive type. I like it</seg>
<seg id="7093">50	486	I knew he'd do this. It happens every year.</seg>
<seg id="7094">42	512	I'm gonna call Eli, gonna tell him.</seg>
<seg id="7095">11	332	As my office moves toward the presentation of evidence...</seg>
<seg id="7096">35	309	voluptuous. of course. graceful. witty. confident...</seg>
<seg id="7097">54	43	This baby won me second placein the clinic's weekly "weirdest thing pulled outof an orifice" contest.</seg>
<seg id="7098">25	473	It's not worth skinning a person for.</seg>
<seg id="7099">6	3	In the ways of my country,</seg>
<seg id="7100">15	990	Why just stand there? Hurry up</seg>
<seg id="7101">18	267	That from someone who thinks b-flat means to fully recline.</seg>
<seg id="7102">25	293	How about "eagle's eye" and "deepest deep" now, eh?</seg>
<seg id="7103">22	478	Take everything apart, brick by brick.</seg>
<seg id="7104">35	71	He's about to transform into the Indian MC Hammer.</seg>
<seg id="7105">15	103	It's ajoyful event. My fiance's graduating in medicine</seg>
<seg id="7106">13	166	Though my doctor is down the block.</seg>
<seg id="7107">53	200	You don't need to go to school wow, feels really great great smell, did you smell it?</seg>
<seg id="7108">21	248	How'd I do? Ninety? Hundred? One-twenty.</seg>
<seg id="7109">42	623	I don't actually have any questions.</seg>
<seg id="7110">11	463	Just luck! They could've been all killed.</seg>
<seg id="7111">47	94	And may again have had something to do with the way Caesar was perceived in Rome, and to his eventual demise.</seg>
<seg id="7112">33	215	The way I figure it, it's like three sticks of old dynamite.</seg>
<seg id="7113">35	618	Surprised to see your old friend Johnny?</seg>
<seg id="7114">51	642	He'll be back... For his jacket.</seg>
<seg id="7115">23	701	Wait a minute. Wait. You're a Neil Diamond fan too?</seg>
<seg id="7116">13	720	Boy, honey, your life is scary.</seg>
<seg id="7117">45	221	In this case, the Theater of Marcellus appears to have had three stories, only two of which are currently persevered.</seg>
<seg id="7118">42	418	You've got some nerve hitting on my-- - I swear I didn't tell anyone!</seg>
<seg id="7119">2	683	That, I can manage a task,</seg>
<seg id="7120">22	194	Means nothing to those people buried in the ground.</seg>
<seg id="7121">23	1091	Judith and I are getting married tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="7122">32	153	Would you mind very much if Dennis and I went up to his room?</seg>
<seg id="7123">28	365	Fool Ford can't even remember a simple little thing.</seg>
<seg id="7124">16	7	You don't even know this kid</seg>
<seg id="7125">8	298	If you want to eat down here, you'll have to teach them something new every day,</seg>
<seg id="7126">20	60	When we come to work here, we are asked to sign release forms.</seg>
<seg id="7127">51	263	The world doesn't want to be saved. It sucks.</seg>
<seg id="7128">15	133	Now they're applying for leave to get married</seg>
<seg id="7129">19	167	Follow Young One and help him out.</seg>
<seg id="7130">2	47	No, that was clearly my idea.</seg>
<seg id="7131">6	88	I wish you a son, you're a great man,</seg>
<seg id="7132">1	45	Why would she task location and sales to one person?</seg>
<seg id="7133">53	101	You really have to get it, Shigeru</seg>
<seg id="7134">7	572	Good.    -You'll never guess.</seg>
<seg id="7135">45	306	You don't need it for most places, but for the Vatican, the Colosseum, the most popular, it's not a bad idea to get tickets in advance, because then you can go on the short line, instead of the line that you're going to have to wait for hours to get in.</seg>
<seg id="7136">7	1207	Just my luck. Just my rotten luck.</seg>
<seg id="7137">17	174	I think we sold it at the garage sale, which, if I remember correctly, you told me to.</seg>
<seg id="7138">46	187	And the Silenus, while looking back toward the woman, is holding a large cup from which one of the satyrs is drinking.</seg>
<seg id="7139">13	663	And all the uniforms will be supplied by me. The mother.</seg>
<seg id="7140">31	234	And callaghan... well, sir, he's hurt pretty bad.</seg>
<seg id="7141">47	72	So this whole idea of temple in a rectangular complex.</seg>
<seg id="7142">16	34	Everything - He's home - Home?</seg>
<seg id="7143">11	374	Yes, good morning, base. Any update on the convoy?</seg>
<seg id="7144">8	367	Patience is the only thing for which I set myself a limit,</seg>
<seg id="7145">23	384	Out of the blue, Judith proposed to me. We're engaged.</seg>
<seg id="7146">51	244	Choices. What choice did I have when Duff put a gun to my head?</seg>
<seg id="7147">12	173	That was ages ago. Look, no graffiti, air conditioning works.</seg>
<seg id="7148">27	678	But it was brutal, perverted, had to be destroyed at a terrible cost.</seg>
<seg id="7149">17	426	My sister Jessi, she's been having some problems, more than just the typical teenage things, and I was hoping that you might be able to sit down with her.</seg>
<seg id="7150">35	270	It's so kind of you to invite Jaya.</seg>
<seg id="7151">15	303	It's put out! Why scream? All your fault! Why did you smoke? Look</seg>
<seg id="7152">21	5	You know, there was an Aunt Clara on the original Bewitched.</seg>
<seg id="7153">6	588	But in his short life he achieved with out doubt, the mythic glory of his ancestor hercules and more,</seg>
<seg id="7154">18	191	They want me to show them what I can do.</seg>
<seg id="7155">7	15	Bobby, l decided what l wanna be.</seg>
<seg id="7156">12	289	...that's gonna make your boy rich and famous.</seg>
<seg id="7157">11	37	And then, you know, for my last two years at school...</seg>
<seg id="7158">22	10	Take the left flank, Hargs. - Sir.</seg>
<seg id="7159">25	903	But knowing what it would mean for you to leave, it will entertain me more to remember where I left you to rot.</seg>
<seg id="7160">13	67	You are not getting out of going in there with me. Period.</seg>
<seg id="7161">44	91	Basically, glory and the great power rivalries is the biggest reason that Germany gets into the imperial game,</seg>
<seg id="7162">45	135	We see a view of the Colosseum from above, a Google Earth image of the Colosseum, from above.</seg>
<seg id="7163">17	563	It doesn't matter. I just wanna say I'm sorry.</seg>
<seg id="7164">1	360	But what the audience is gonna do is go, "oh, I was in the impression of nan.</seg>
<seg id="7165">28	196	We mean you no harm. We are only here searching for a friend.</seg>
<seg id="7166">11	300	Well, man, tell them to put the damn sticker on here, man.</seg>
<seg id="7167">20	412	And that's a good thing? - No.</seg>
<seg id="7168">20	236	Well, you are the luckiest man in San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="7169">22	231	Quit it. Let's pack and roll, people.</seg>
<seg id="7170">43	345	Well, aren't our public servants too laid-back?</seg>
<seg id="7171">1	87	Stephanie was responsible for about half of those sales.</seg>
<seg id="7172">32	808	Here on some kind of exploratory mission...</seg>
<seg id="7173">11	338	...That the referral by the Security Council of this issue to the ICC...</seg>
<seg id="7174">3	480	We don't mind others knowing about our revolution.</seg>
<seg id="7175">8	295	MAN: Strangling him won't do any good,</seg>
<seg id="7176">29	51	That's all I can think it could be.</seg>
<seg id="7177">13	16	What are you doing? - Having a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="7178">13	636	Nothing Shakespeare couldn't turn into a really good play.</seg>
<seg id="7179">31	177	...which would leave the North Koreans capable of a fullstrength retaliation...</seg>
<seg id="7180">17	302	Then you'd have to borrow my car, and my car doesn't get nearly the mileage your car gets.</seg>
<seg id="7181">37	104	You're not ill and hiding it from me, are you, Sid?</seg>
<seg id="7182">42	182	Could you pass me the Berkman quarterly profit breakdown?</seg>
<seg id="7183">31	239	Additionally, sir, Lieutenant James is reporting...</seg>
